## 5.3.4 Building a Profile Page

Welcome to an exciting part of your Flutter journey where you'll learn to build a user profile page! A profile page is like a personal card that shows information about a user, such as their name, picture, and hobbies. It's a great way to apply your knowledge of layout, containers, rows, and columns. Let's dive in and create a simple yet stylish profile page!

### Understanding the Profile Page

A profile page is a common feature in many apps, from social media to games. It provides a snapshot of a user's identity and interests. Here's what we'll include in our profile page:

- **Profile Picture:** A visual representation of the user.
- **User Information:** Details like name, age, and hobbies.
- **Interactive Buttons:** Options to edit the profile or view activities.

### Key Concepts

Before we start coding, let's review some key concepts:

- **Profile Picture:** We'll use an `Image` widget to display a user's photo. This can be a fun way to personalize the page.
- **User Information:** `Text` widgets will help us show details like the user's name, age, and interests.
- **Layout Combination:** By combining `Row`, `Column`, and `Container` widgets, we can create an organized and visually appealing profile layout.

### Building the Profile Page

Let's create our profile page step by step. Below is a complete code example to guide you through the process:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(ProfilePageApp());
}

class ProfilePageApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('User Profile'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              CircleAvatar(
                radius: 50,
                backgroundImage: AssetImage('assets/images/profile.jpg'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Alex Johnson',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              Text(
                'Age: 12',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              Text(
                'Hobbies: Painting, Reading, Gaming',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
                children: [
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {},
                    child: Text('Edit Profile'),
                  ),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {},
                    child: Text('View Activities'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Note:** Make sure to add the profile image (`assets/images/profile.jpg`) to your project's assets folder.

### Code Breakdown

- **CircleAvatar:** This widget is used to display the profile picture in a circular frame. The `radius` property controls the size of the circle.
- **Text Widgets:** These are used to display the user's name, age, and hobbies. The `style` property allows us to customize the font size and weight.
- **Row and Column:** These widgets help us organize the layout. The `Column` widget stacks elements vertically, while the `Row` widget arranges them horizontally.
- **ElevatedButton:** These buttons provide interactive options for the user. You can add functionality to these buttons by defining actions in the `onPressed` property.

### Visualizing the Layout

To better understand the structure of our profile page, let's use a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Column] --> B[Profile Picture]
    A --> C[User Name]
    A --> D[Age]
    A --> E[Hobbies]
    A --> F[Buttons Row]
    F --> G[Edit Profile Button]
    F --> H[View Activities Button]
```

This diagram shows how each element is organized within the `Column` and `Row` widgets, creating a neat and structured layout.

### Activity: Customize Your Profile Page

Now it's your turn! Customize your profile page by:

- Changing the profile image to one of your choice.
- Adding more information, such as a favorite quote or a list of achievements.
- Styling the text and buttons with different colors and fonts.

### Encouragement and Engagement

Remember, your profile page is a reflection of you! Be creative and have fun with it. Once you're happy with your design, share your profile page with friends or family members. You can even add more personal touches and features as you become more comfortable with layout techniques.

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Consistency:** Keep your design consistent with similar styles and spacing.
- **Readability:** Ensure text is easy to read with appropriate font sizes and colors.
- **Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to try new layouts and styles. Experimentation is a great way to learn!

By building this profile page, you've taken another step towards mastering Flutter and creating interactive apps. Keep exploring and pushing the boundaries of your creativity!
