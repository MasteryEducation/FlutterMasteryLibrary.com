## 3.3.4 Mini Project: To-Do List App

Welcome to your next coding adventure! In this mini project, we'll be building a simple yet functional To-Do List app using Flutter. This project will help you understand how to manipulate lists, handle user input, and create a user-friendly interface. Let's dive in!

### Objective

The main goal of this project is to apply list manipulation techniques by creating an app where users can add tasks to a list, view them, and remove completed tasks. This will enhance your understanding of how lists work in programming and how to interact with them in a Flutter app.

### Project Overview

Our To-Do List app will have the following features:
- An input field for users to add new tasks.
- A display area to show the list of tasks.
- Functionality to remove tasks once they are completed.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Let's break down the process of building our To-Do List app into manageable steps.

#### 1. Set Up the UI

First, we need to set up the user interface (UI) of our app. This includes creating input fields for adding tasks and a list display area.

- **Input Field:** We'll use a `TextField` widget to allow users to enter new tasks.
- **List Display:** A `ListView` widget will be used to display the tasks.

#### 2. Create a List Variable

Next, we need to declare a list variable to store our to-do items. This list will hold all the tasks that the user adds.

```dart
List<String> tasks = [];
```

#### 3. Add Tasks

We'll write a function to add new tasks to our list. This function will take the text from the input field and add it to the list.

```dart
void addTask() {
  setState(() {
    tasks.add(_controller.text);
    _controller.clear();
  });
}
```

#### 4. Display Tasks

To display each task in the UI, we'll use a loop within a `ListView.builder`. This allows us to dynamically create a list of widgets based on the number of tasks.

```dart
Expanded(
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: tasks.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text(tasks[index]),
        trailing: IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.delete),
          onPressed: () => removeTask(index),
        ),
      );
    },
  ),
)
```

#### 5. Remove Tasks

Finally, we'll implement functionality to remove tasks when they are completed. This involves writing a function that removes a task from the list based on its index.

```dart
void removeTask(int index) {
  setState(() {
    tasks.removeAt(index);
  });
}
```

### Complete Code Example

Here's the complete code for our To-Do List app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(ToDoListApp());
}

class ToDoListApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ToDoListAppState createState() => _ToDoListAppState();
}

class _ToDoListAppState extends State<ToDoListApp> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<String> tasks = [];

  void addTask() {
    setState(() {
      tasks.add(_controller.text);
      _controller.clear();
    });
  }

  void removeTask(int index) {
    setState(() {
      tasks.removeAt(index);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('To-Do List'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                controller: _controller,
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter a task'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: addTask,
                child: Text('Add Task'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Expanded(
                child: ListView.builder(
                  itemCount: tasks.length,
                  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                    return ListTile(
                      title: Text(tasks[index]),
                      trailing: IconButton(
                        icon: Icon(Icons.delete),
                        onPressed: () => removeTask(index),
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Visuals

Let's visualize the flow of our To-Do List app using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[User Enters Task]
    B --> C[Press 'Add Task']
    C --> D[Add Task to List]
    D --> E[Display Task in List]
    E --> F[Press 'Delete' to Remove Task]
    F --> D
```

### Engagement and Creativity

Congratulations on building your To-Do List app! This project is a great starting point for exploring more complex app functionalities. Here are some ideas to extend your app:
- Add a feature to mark tasks as completed without removing them.
- Implement a filter to show only completed or pending tasks.
- Allow users to edit existing tasks.

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep Your Code Organized:** Use functions to separate different parts of your code, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Test Your App:** Regularly test your app to ensure all features work as expected.
- **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to try new things and see what works best for your app.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to Call `setState`:** Remember to call `setState` whenever you modify the list to update the UI.
- **Handling Empty Inputs:** Ensure that users cannot add empty tasks by checking the input before adding it to the list.

### Conclusion

You've successfully created a To-Do List app using Flutter! This project has taught you how to manipulate lists, handle user input, and create a simple yet effective user interface. Keep experimenting and adding new features to your app. Happy coding!
