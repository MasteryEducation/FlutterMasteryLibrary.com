## 12.2.2 How You Can Shape the Future

As you reach the end of this coding journey, it's time to look forward and imagine the incredible possibilities that lie ahead. By learning to code, you've unlocked a powerful toolset that can help you shape the future. Let's explore how you can use your skills to become a future innovator, solve real-world problems, and make a positive impact on the world.

### Empowerment Through Coding

Coding is more than just writing lines of code; it's about creating solutions, building innovative products, and making positive changes in the world. With coding, you have the power to:

- **Create Solutions:** Identify problems in your community or the world and develop technological solutions to address them.
- **Build Innovative Products:** Use your creativity and coding skills to design apps, games, and tools that can improve lives.
- **Make Positive Changes:** Contribute to projects that promote sustainability, education, health, and more.

### Identifying Problems to Solve

The first step in shaping the future is identifying problems that need solutions. Look around you—what challenges do you see? How can technology help solve them? Here are some ideas to get you started:

- **Homework Helper App:** Create an app that assists students with their homework by providing resources, tips, and reminders.
- **Educational Game:** Design a game that teaches coding concepts in a fun and engaging way.
- **Environmental Tool:** Build a tool that helps track and reduce energy consumption or waste.

### Innovation and Creativity

Innovation requires creativity and the ability to think outside the box. Here are some tips to foster your creative thinking:

- **Brainstorm Freely:** Allow yourself to think without limits. Write down all ideas, no matter how wild they seem.
- **Combine Ideas:** Mix different concepts to create something new and unique.
- **Prototype Quickly:** Build simple versions of your ideas to test and improve them.

### Role Models: Young Innovators

Many young people have already made significant contributions to technology. Here are a few inspiring stories:

- **Alex Knoll:** At just 12 years old, Alex created the Ability App, which helps people with disabilities find accessible places and services.
- **Emma Yang:** Emma developed the Timeless app to help Alzheimer's patients recognize their loved ones and stay connected.
- **Samaira Mehta:** At age 10, Samaira invented CoderBunnyz, a board game that teaches coding concepts to kids.

These young innovators show that age is no barrier to making a difference. You, too, can start your journey now!

### Visualizing Your Impact

Let's visualize how your coding skills can lead to a positive global impact:

This diagram illustrates the journey from learning to code to making a significant impact on the world. Each step builds on the previous one, showing how your skills can lead to meaningful change.

### Interactive Exercise: Brainstorm Your App

Now it's your turn to brainstorm and sketch an app or tool you'd like to create. Think about a problem you care about and how technology can help solve it. Use the following prompts to guide your brainstorming:

- **What problem do you want to solve?**
- **Who will benefit from your solution?**
- **What features will your app or tool have?**

Take some time to sketch your ideas and write down your thoughts. Remember, there's no right or wrong answer—just let your creativity flow!

### Visual Aids and Inspiration

To inspire you further, here are some images and quotes from young inventors and tech innovations making a difference:

- **Image of a Young Inventor:** A photo of a young person working on a tech project.
- **Inspirational Quote:** "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." – Alan Kay
