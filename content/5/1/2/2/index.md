## 1.2.2 Installing Flutter and Dart

Welcome to the exciting world of coding! Before we dive into creating amazing apps, we need to set up our coding environment. This means installing Flutter and Dart on your computer. Don't worry if this sounds complicatedâ€”I'm here to guide you through each step. Let's get started!

### Why Flutter and Dart?

Flutter is a powerful tool that helps us create beautiful apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase. Dart is the programming language we use with Flutter. Together, they make coding fun and efficient!

### Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Flutter and Dart

Let's break down the installation process into simple steps. Follow along, and you'll have Flutter and Dart ready in no time!

#### Step 1: Check Your System Requirements

Before installing, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit), macOS (64-bit), or Linux (64-bit).
- **Disk Space:** At least 1.32 GB (not including disk space for IDE/tools).
- **Tools:** Git for Windows is required for Windows users.

#### Step 2: Download Flutter SDK

1. **Visit the Flutter Website:** Go to [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) and click on the "Get Started" button.

2. **Choose Your Operating System:** Select your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to download the Flutter SDK.

3. **Download the SDK:** Click the download link to get the Flutter SDK zip file.

#### Step 3: Extract the Flutter SDK

1. **Locate the Downloaded File:** Find the Flutter SDK zip file in your Downloads folder.

2. **Extract the File:** Right-click the zip file and select "Extract All" (Windows) or "Open With > Archive Utility" (macOS).

3. **Choose a Location:** Extract the files to a location where you have write permissions, such as `C:\src\flutter` on Windows or `~/flutter` on macOS.

#### Step 4: Update Your System Path

To run Flutter commands from the terminal, we need to add Flutter to our system path.

- **Windows:**
  1. Open the Start Search, type "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
  2. Click "Environment Variables".
  3. Under "System variables", find the "Path" variable and click "Edit".
  4. Click "New" and add the path to the Flutter `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\src\flutter\bin`).
  5. Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.

- **macOS/Linux:**
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Run `nano ~/.bash_profile` or `nano ~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell).
  3. Add the line `export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"`.
  4. Save the file and run `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

#### Step 5: Verify the Installation

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:** Type `flutter doctor` and press Enter.

2. **Check for Issues:** Flutter will check your environment and display a report. Follow any additional instructions to complete the setup.

#### Step 6: Install Dart

Good news! Dart is included with Flutter, so there's no need for a separate installation. Running `flutter doctor` ensures Dart is installed correctly.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue:** Flutter command not found.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the Flutter `bin` directory is added to your system path correctly.

- **Issue:** Missing dependencies.
  - **Solution:** Follow the instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to install any missing dependencies.

- **Issue:** Permission denied errors.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the installation directory.

### Interactive Element: Ask for Help

If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to ask an adult for help. Installing software can sometimes be tricky, but teamwork makes it easier!

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Flutter and Dart. You're now ready to start building your first app. Remember, every great coder started where you are now. Keep exploring, experimenting, and most importantly, have fun!
