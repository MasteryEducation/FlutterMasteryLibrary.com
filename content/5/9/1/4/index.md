## 9.1.4 Mini Project: Custom Button Set

Creating custom widgets in Flutter is a fantastic way to make your apps unique and reusable. In this mini-project, we'll guide you through designing a set of custom-styled buttons that you can use throughout your apps. These buttons will not only look great but also enhance your app's functionality by providing consistent and reusable components.

### Project Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to create a collection of buttons with different styles. These buttons can be used for various actions in your app, such as playing a game, opening settings, or quitting the app. By the end of this project, you'll have a set of buttons that you can easily customize and reuse in any Flutter app you create.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Designing Button Variations

Before we start coding, let's think about the different types of buttons we want to create. Here are some ideas:

- **Colors:** Create buttons with different colors to represent different actions. For example, a green button for "Play," a blue button for "Settings," and a red button for "Quit."
- **Shapes:** Experiment with different shapes, such as rounded or rectangular buttons.
- **Sizes:** Design buttons of various sizes to fit different parts of your app.

#### 2. Creating a Custom Button Widget

Let's start by creating a custom button widget in Flutter. This widget will allow us to easily create buttons with different styles.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;
  final Color color;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  CustomButton({
    required this.label,
    required this.color,
    required this.onPressed,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
        primary: color,
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20.0, vertical: 15.0),
        shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
        ),
      ),
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(
        label,
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`CustomButton` Class:** This class extends `StatelessWidget`, meaning it doesn't hold any state. It's perfect for our button since the button's appearance doesn't change.
- **Parameters:** The button takes three parameters: `label` for the text, `color` for the button's background, and `onPressed` for the action when the button is tapped.
- **`ElevatedButton`:** We use Flutter's `ElevatedButton` and customize it with `styleFrom` to set the color, padding, and shape.

#### 3. Using the Custom Button in the App

Now, let's use our custom button in a simple app. We'll create a page with a set of buttons.

```dart
class ButtonSetPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Button Set')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            CustomButton(
              label: 'Play',
              color: Colors.green,
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for Play
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            CustomButton(
              label: 'Settings',
              color: Colors.blue,
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for Settings
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            CustomButton(
              label: 'Quit',
              color: Colors.red,
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for Quit
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`ButtonSetPage` Class:** This class creates a simple page with a column of buttons.
- **`CustomButton` Instances:** We create three buttons with different labels and colors. Each button has a placeholder for an action when pressed.

#### 4. Testing the Buttons

Run your app to see the custom buttons in action. Tap each button to ensure they respond correctly. You can add print statements in the `onPressed` callbacks to verify that each button works.

#### 5. Enhancing the Button Set

Let's make our buttons even more exciting:

- **Add Icons:** You can add icons to your buttons by using the `Icon` widget alongside the `Text` widget.
- **Button Effects:** Create buttons that change color when tapped by using the `onHighlightChanged` property.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure your buttons look great on different screen sizes by using `MediaQuery` to adjust their size and padding.

### Mermaid.js Component Diagram

Here's a visual representation of the `CustomButton` widget structure:

```

### Interactive Exercise

Now it's your turn! Try adding more buttons with unique styles or modify the existing ones to suit different needs in your apps. Experiment with different colors, shapes, and sizes. You can also try adding animations or sound effects to your buttons.

### Visual Aids

Below are some screenshots of what your custom buttons might look like in the app:

- **Play Button:** A green button with a play icon.
- **Settings Button:** A blue button with a gear icon.
- **Quit Button:** A red button with an exit icon.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a set of custom-styled buttons in Flutter. These buttons are not only visually appealing but also reusable, making your app development process more efficient. Keep experimenting with different styles and functionalities to make your apps even more engaging.
