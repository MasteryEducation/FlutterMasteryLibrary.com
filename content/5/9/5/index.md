## 9.5 Mini Project: Accessibility Checker

Welcome to another exciting project in our Flutter adventure! In this mini-project, we'll create an **Accessibility Checker** app. This app will help us understand the importance of accessibility in design by checking if the colors we choose for text and backgrounds are easy to read for everyone.

### Project Overview

The Accessibility Checker app will allow users to input text and select colors for the text and background. It will then evaluate these choices based on accessibility standards, particularly focusing on color contrast. This project is a great way to learn about making apps more inclusive and user-friendly.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Let's dive into building our Accessibility Checker app!

#### 1. Setting Up the Project

First, we'll create a new Flutter project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
flutter create accessibility_checker
```

This command sets up a new Flutter project named `accessibility_checker`. Once it's created, open the project in your favorite code editor.

#### 2. Designing the Input Screen

Next, we'll design the input screen where users can enter text and choose colors.

- Open `lib/main.dart` and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(AccessibilityCheckerApp());
}

class AccessibilityCheckerApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Accessibility Checker',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AccessibilityCheckerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AccessibilityCheckerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AccessibilityCheckerScreenState createState() => _AccessibilityCheckerScreenState();
}

class _AccessibilityCheckerScreenState extends State<AccessibilityCheckerScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _textController = TextEditingController();
  Color _textColor = Colors.black;
  Color _backgroundColor = Colors.white;
  String _feedback = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Accessibility Checker'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _textController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your text here'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              children: [
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => _pickColor(context, true),
                  child: Text('Select Text Color'),
                ),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () => _pickColor(context, false),
                  child: Text('Select Background Color'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _checkAccessibility,
              child: Text('Check Accessibility'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _feedback,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _pickColor(BuildContext context, bool isTextColor) async {
    Color? pickedColor = await showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Pick a color'),
        content: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: ColorPicker(
            pickerColor: isTextColor ? _textColor : _backgroundColor,
            onColorChanged: (color) {
              setState(() {
                if (isTextColor) {
                  _textColor = color;
                } else {
                  _backgroundColor = color;
                }
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
        actions: <Widget>[
          ElevatedButton(
            child: Text('Select'),
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.of(context).pop();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void _checkAccessibility() {
    bool isGoodContrast = isContrastGood(_textColor, _backgroundColor);
    setState(() {
      _feedback = getContrastFeedback(isGoodContrast);
    });
  }

  bool isContrastGood(Color fg, Color bg) {
    double contrast = (fg.computeLuminance() + 0.05) / (bg.computeLuminance() + 0.05);
    return contrast > 1.5;
  }

  String getContrastFeedback(bool isGood) {
    return isGood ? 'Good contrast!' : 'Poor contrast. Consider different colors.';
  }
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - We created a simple UI with a `TextField` for input, buttons to select text and background colors, and a button to check accessibility.
  - The `_pickColor` function allows users to choose colors.
  - The `_checkAccessibility` function evaluates the color contrast.

#### 3. Implementing Accessibility Check

The core of our app is checking if the chosen colors have good contrast. We use a simple formula to calculate contrast:

```dart
bool isContrastGood(Color fg, Color bg) {
  double contrast = (fg.computeLuminance() + 0.05) / (bg.computeLuminance() + 0.05);
  return contrast > 1.5;
}

String getContrastFeedback(bool isGood) {
  return isGood ? 'Good contrast!' : 'Poor contrast. Consider different colors.';
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `computeLuminance()` calculates the brightness of a color.
  - We compare the luminance of the foreground (text) and background colors to determine if the contrast is sufficient.

#### 4. Displaying Feedback

After checking the contrast, we display feedback to the user. The feedback is shown as a simple text message indicating whether the contrast is good or poor.

#### 5. Enhancing the App

To make our app more helpful, let's add some enhancements:

- **Recommendations:** Suggest color combinations that meet accessibility standards.
- **Color Palettes:** Provide a list of accessible color palettes for users to choose from.

You can expand the app by adding a list of recommended colors and updating the UI to allow users to select from these options.

#### 6. Testing the App

Finally, test your app by trying different text and background color combinations. Ensure that the feedback accurately reflects the accessibility of the chosen colors.

### Complete Code Example
