## 2.3.4 Mini Project: Calculator App

Welcome to an exciting mini-project where you'll apply your newfound Flutter skills to build a simple calculator app! This project will help you understand how to create a user interface, handle user input, and perform basic arithmetic operations. Let's dive in!

### Objective

The goal of this project is to create a calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By the end of this project, you'll have a functional app that takes two numbers as input and displays the result of the selected operation.

### Project Overview

Our calculator app will consist of:

- **Text Fields** for entering two numbers.
- **Buttons** for each arithmetic operation.
- A **Display Area** to show the result of the calculation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Set Up the UI

First, we need to create the user interface (UI) for our calculator. This involves setting up text fields for input and buttons for each operation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(CalculatorApp());
}

class CalculatorApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalculatorAppState createState() => _CalculatorAppState();
}

class _CalculatorAppState extends State<CalculatorApp> {
  double num1 = 0;
  double num2 = 0;
  double result = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Calculator'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Number 1'),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  num1 = double.parse(value);
                },
              ),
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Number 2'),
                keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  num2 = double.parse(value);
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Row(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
                children: [
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      setState(() {
                        result = num1 + num2;
                      });
                    },
                    child: Text('+'),
                  ),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      setState(() {
                        result = num1 - num2;
                      });
                    },
                    child: Text('-'),
                  ),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      setState(() {
                        result = num1 * num2;
                      });
                    },
                    child: Text('*'),
                  ),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      setState(() {
                        result = num1 / num2;
                      });
                    },
                    child: Text('/'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Result: $result',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### 2. Create Variables

In the code above, we declared three variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `result`. These variables will store the numbers entered by the user and the result of the calculation.

- **num1**: Stores the first number.
- **num2**: Stores the second number.
- **result**: Stores the result of the operation.

#### 3. Write Functions

For each arithmetic operation, we have a button that, when pressed, performs the operation and updates the `result` variable. The `setState` method is used to update the UI with the new result.

#### 4. Display Results

The result of the calculation is displayed in a `Text` widget, which updates whenever a button is pressed.

### Visuals

Let's visualize the flow of our calculator app using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Inputs Numbers] --> B[Selects Operation];
    B --> C[Perform Calculation];
    C --> D[Display Result];
```

### Language and Engagement

Feel free to experiment with different numbers and operations. Try adding more features, such as a clear button to reset the inputs or additional operations like modulus or exponentiation.

### Celebrate Your Achievement
