## 2.1.3 Modifying Text in Your First Flutter App

Welcome back, young coders! Now that you've created your first Flutter app, it's time to make it truly yours by modifying the text displayed on the screen. This is a fun and simple way to start customizing your app and make it say exactly what you want. Let's dive into how you can change the text in your Flutter app.

### Objective

The goal of this section is to show you how to customize the text displayed in your app. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to change the text to say anything you like, whether it's your name, a fun message, or something else entirely!

### Explanation

In Flutter, text is displayed using a special tool called a **Text widget**. This widget is like a little box that holds the words you want to show on the screen. By changing the words inside this box, you can make your app say anything you want. Let's see how to do this step by step.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Open `main.dart`

First, we need to open the file where our app's code lives. This file is called `main.dart`. Here's how you can find and open it:

- Open your code editor (like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio).
- In the project explorer on the left side, look for a folder named `lib`.
- Inside the `lib` folder, you'll find the `main.dart` file. Click on it to open.

#### 2. Find the Text Widget

Now that you have `main.dart` open, let's find the line of code that displays the text. Look for a line that looks like this:

```dart
Text('Hello, World!')
```

This line is telling Flutter to display the words "Hello, World!" on the screen.

#### 3. Change the Message

Here's the fun part! You can change the text inside the quotes to anything you like. Let's try changing it to "Welcome to Flutter!". Here's how:

- Click inside the quotes where it says `'Hello, World!'`.
- Delete the words "Hello, World!" and type in "Welcome to Flutter!" instead.

Your code should now look like this:

```dart
child: Text('Welcome to Flutter!'),
```

#### 4. Save and Run

After making changes to your code, it's important to save your work and run the app again to see the changes. Here's how:

- Save the file by clicking on the save icon or pressing `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Cmd + S` (Mac).
- Run the app by clicking the play button in your code editor or typing `flutter run` in the terminal.

Once the app is running, you should see your new message displayed on the screen!

### Code Example

Here's the complete code snippet with the modified text:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My First Flutter App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to Flutter!'), // Modified text here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Visuals

Let's use a diagram to highlight the part of the code you changed. Here's a simple Mermaid.js diagram showing the modification:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[main.dart] --> B[Text Widget];
    B --> C["Text('Hello, World!')"];
    C --> D["Text('Welcome to Flutter!')"];
```

### Language and Creativity

Feel free to get creative with the text you display! You can write a short message, your name, or even a fun greeting. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- "Hello, [Your Name]!"
- "Flutter is Fun!"
- "Coding Rocks!"

### Engagement Challenge

Now it's your turn! Try writing a short message or your name in the app. What will you make your app say? Share your creative messages with friends or family and see what fun ideas they come up with too!
