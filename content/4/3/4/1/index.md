## 3.4.1 Project Overview

In this section, we embark on an exciting journey to build a simple yet functional console-based calculator using Dart. This project serves as a practical application of the foundational concepts covered in the previous sections, such as variables, data types, control flow statements, and functions. By the end of this project, you'll have a deeper understanding of how to structure a Dart program, handle user input and output, and manage basic error scenarios.

### Project Description

The Simple Calculator Console App is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is an excellent opportunity to apply your knowledge of Dart programming in a real-world scenario. The calculator will prompt users to enter two numbers and select an operation. It will then display the result of the computation, ensuring that invalid inputs and division by zero are handled gracefully.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Apply Dart Basics:** Utilize your understanding of variables, data types, control flow statements, and functions to build a functional application.
- **Program Structuring:** Gain experience in structuring a Dart program effectively, ensuring readability and maintainability.
- **User Input/Output Handling:** Learn how to interact with users through the console, capturing input and displaying output.
- **Error Management:** Implement basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios.

### Expected Features

The Simple Calculator Console App will include the following features:

- **User Input:** Prompt the user to enter two numbers. This involves capturing input from the console and converting it to a suitable data type for arithmetic operations.
- **Operation Selection:** Allow the user to select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on the entered numbers.
- **Result Display:** Compute the result of the selected operation and display it to the user.
- **Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric entries, and manage division by zero gracefully.

### Project Workflow

To provide a clear understanding of the project's workflow, let's visualize the process using a Mermaid.js diagram:

  A[Simple Calculator Console App] --> B[User Input]
  A --> C[Select Operation]
  A --> D[Perform Calculation]
  A --> E[Display Result]
  A --> F[Error Handling]
  
  B --> B1[Enter First Number]
  B --> B2[Enter Second Number]
  
  C --> C1[Choose +, -, *, /]
  
  D --> D1[Invoke Functions]
  
  F --> F1[Invalid Number]
  F --> F2[Division by Zero]
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### User Input

The first step in our calculator app is to capture user input. This involves prompting the user to enter two numbers. In Dart, we can use the `stdin.readLineSync()` method to read input from the console. Here's a simple example:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print('Enter the first number:');
  String? input1 = stdin.readLineSync();
  double number1 = double.parse(input1!);

  print('Enter the second number:');
  String? input2 = stdin.readLineSync();
  double number2 = double.parse(input2!);
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The `stdin.readLineSync()` method reads a line of text from the console.
- We use `double.parse()` to convert the string input into a double for arithmetic operations.
- Error handling for invalid inputs will be discussed later.

#### Selecting an Operation

Once we have the two numbers, the next step is to allow the user to select an arithmetic operation. We can achieve this using a simple menu system:

```dart
print('Select an operation:');
print('1. Addition (+)');
print('2. Subtraction (-)');
print('3. Multiplication (*)');
print('4. Division (/)');

String? operation = stdin.readLineSync();
```

**Key Points:**

- We present a menu of operations to the user.
- The user's choice is captured as a string, which we will use to determine the operation to perform.

#### Performing the Calculation

With the numbers and operation selected, we can perform the calculation. This involves using control flow statements to determine which operation to execute:

```dart
double result;

switch (operation) {
  case '1':
    result = number1 + number2;
    break;
  case '2':
    result = number1 - number2;
    break;
  case '3':
    result = number1 * number2;
    break;
  case '4':
    if (number2 != 0) {
      result = number1 / number2;
    } else {
      print('Error: Division by zero is not allowed.');
      return;
    }
    break;
  default:
    print('Invalid operation selected.');
    return;
}

print('The result is: $result');
```

**Key Points:**

- We use a `switch` statement to determine the operation based on the user's choice.
- Division by zero is handled explicitly by checking if the second number is zero before performing the division.
- If an invalid operation is selected, an error message is displayed.

#### Error Handling

Error handling is a crucial part of any application. In our calculator app, we need to manage two primary error scenarios: invalid number inputs and division by zero.

- **Invalid Number Input:** We can use a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions that occur when parsing the input:

  ```dart
  try {
    double number1 = double.parse(input1!);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.');
    return;
  }
  ```

- **Division by Zero:** As shown in the calculation section, we check if the divisor is zero before performing the division.

### Practical Code Example

Here's the complete code for the Simple Calculator Console App:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print('Enter the first number:');
  String? input1 = stdin.readLineSync();
  double number1;

  try {
    number1 = double.parse(input1!);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.');
    return;
  }

  print('Enter the second number:');
  String? input2 = stdin.readLineSync();
  double number2;

  try {
    number2 = double.parse(input2!);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.');
    return;
  }

  print('Select an operation:');
  print('1. Addition (+)');
  print('2. Subtraction (-)');
  print('3. Multiplication (*)');
  print('4. Division (/)');

  String? operation = stdin.readLineSync();
  double result;

  switch (operation) {
    case '1':
      result = number1 + number2;
      break;
    case '2':
      result = number1 - number2;
      break;
    case '3':
      result = number1 * number2;
      break;
    case '4':
      if (number2 != 0) {
        result = number1 / number2;
      } else {
        print('Error: Division by zero is not allowed.');
        return;
      }
      break;
    default:
      print('Invalid operation selected.');
      return;
  }

  print('The result is: $result');
}
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Input Validation:** Always validate user input to prevent runtime errors and ensure the program behaves as expected.
- **Error Messages:** Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users in correcting their input.
- **Code Readability:** Use meaningful variable names and comments to enhance code readability and maintainability.
