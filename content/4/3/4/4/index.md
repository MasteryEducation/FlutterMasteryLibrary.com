## 3.4.4 Running and Testing the Simple Calculator Console App

In this section, we will explore how to run and test your Simple Calculator Console App, ensuring it functions correctly and provides a smooth user experience. This involves executing the app, interacting with it, testing various scenarios, and enhancing the user experience with continuous calculations and clear prompts.

### Running the Calculator App

Running your Dart application can be done through the command line or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Both methods have their advantages, and you can choose based on your preference and setup.

#### Using Command Line

Running your app from the command line is straightforward and allows you to quickly test changes without the overhead of an IDE. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your Dart project.
3. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   dart run bin/simple_calculator.dart
   ```

This command compiles and runs your Dart application, allowing you to interact with it directly in the terminal.

#### Using IDE

If you prefer a graphical interface, running your app through an IDE like Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA can be more convenient. Here’s how to do it:

- **Visual Studio Code/Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA:**
  1. Open the `simple_calculator.dart` file in your IDE.
  2. Locate the **Run** button, typically represented by a green triangle, or use the IDE’s run command (often accessible via a menu or keyboard shortcut).
  3. Click the **Run** button to execute the app.

Running the app through an IDE provides additional benefits such as debugging tools, code suggestions, and a more integrated development experience.

### Sample Interaction

Once your app is running, you can interact with it through the console. Here’s an example of what a typical session might look like:

```
Enter first number:
10
Enter second number:
5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /):
/
Result: 2.0
```

This interaction demonstrates the basic functionality of your calculator app, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations and receive immediate feedback.

### Testing Different Scenarios

Testing is a crucial step in ensuring your app handles various inputs and edge cases gracefully. Here are some scenarios to consider:

#### Valid Operations

Test each arithmetic operation with different numbers to ensure accuracy:

- **Addition:** Try adding two positive numbers, a positive and a negative number, and two negative numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Test subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones and vice versa.
- **Multiplication:** Multiply numbers of varying magnitudes.
- **Division:** Divide numbers and verify the result, especially with decimals.

#### Invalid Operations

Input an unsupported operator (e.g., `%`) to test how your app handles unexpected inputs. Ensure it provides a meaningful error message or default behavior.

#### Division by Zero

Attempt to divide a number by zero to ensure your app handles this scenario without crashing. Implement error handling to display an appropriate message.

#### Non-Numeric Inputs

Enter non-numeric values to test input parsing and error catching. Your app should prompt the user to enter valid numbers.

### Enhancing User Experience

Improving the user experience involves making the app more intuitive and user-friendly. Here are some enhancements you can implement:

#### Looping for Continuous Calculations

Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the app. This can be achieved by wrapping the main logic in a loop:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  while (true) {
    // Existing calculator code
    print('Enter first number:');
    double? num1 = double.tryParse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

    print('Enter second number:');
    double? num2 = double.tryParse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

    print('Choose operation (+, -, *, /):');
    String? operation = stdin.readLineSync();

    if (num1 != null && num2 != null && operation != null) {
      double result;
      switch (operation) {
        case '+':
          result = num1 + num2;
          break;
        case '-':
          result = num1 - num2;
          break;
        case '*':
          result = num1 * num2;
          break;
        case '/':
          if (num2 != 0) {
            result = num1 / num2;
          } else {
            print('Error: Division by zero is not allowed.');
            continue;
          }
          break;
        default:
          print('Invalid operation. Please try again.');
          continue;
      }
      print('Result: $result');
    } else {
      print('Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.');
    }

    print('Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n):');
    String? choice = stdin.readLineSync();
    if (choice == null || choice.toLowerCase() != 'y') {
      print('Goodbye!');
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

This code snippet allows users to continue performing calculations until they choose to exit.

#### Clear Instructions and Prompts

Ensure that prompts are clear and informative to guide user input. For example, specify the expected input format and provide examples where necessary.

### Mermaid.js Diagram

To visualize the process of running and testing your app, consider the following flowchart:
