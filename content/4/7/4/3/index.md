## 7.4.3 Building Screens

In this section, we will delve into the process of building the main screens for our Recipe App. This hands-on project will guide you through creating a Home Screen, Recipe Detail Screen, Add Recipe Screen, and Favorites Screen. Each screen will be designed to interact seamlessly with the others, providing a cohesive user experience. We'll explore how to implement these screens using Flutter's powerful widget system and navigation capabilities.

### Creating the HomeScreen

The HomeScreen serves as the central hub of our Recipe App, displaying a list of recipes with options to view details or add new recipes. This screen is crucial as it provides users with an overview of available recipes and acts as a gateway to other functionalities.

#### Functionality

- Displays a list of recipes.
- Allows users to tap on a recipe to view its details.
- Provides a floating action button to add new recipes.

#### Code Example

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Recipe> recipes = [
    Recipe(
      title: 'Spaghetti Bolognese',
      description: 'A classic Italian dish...',
      imageUrl: 'https://example.com/spaghetti.jpg',
    ),
    Recipe(
      title: 'Chicken Curry',
      description: 'A flavorful Indian curry...',
      imageUrl: 'https://example.com/chicken_curry.jpg',
    ),
    // Add more recipes
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Recipes')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: recipes.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            leading: Image.network(recipes[index].imageUrl, width: 50, height: 50, fit: BoxFit.cover),
            title: Text(recipes[index].title),
            subtitle: Text(recipes[index].description),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(
                context,
                '/detail',
                arguments: recipes[index],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/add');
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
        tooltip: 'Add Recipe',
      ),
    );
  }
}

class Recipe {
  final String title;
  final String description;
  final String imageUrl;

  Recipe({required this.title, required this.description, required this.imageUrl});
}
```

### Creating the RecipeDetailScreen

The RecipeDetailScreen provides users with detailed information about a selected recipe, including ingredients, steps, and images. This screen enhances the user experience by offering comprehensive details about each recipe.

#### Functionality

- Displays detailed information about a recipe.
- Shows ingredients and preparation steps.

#### Code Example

```dart
class RecipeDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final Recipe recipe = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Recipe;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(recipe.title)),
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: <Widget>[
              Image.network(recipe.imageUrl),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              Text(
                recipe.description,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Ingredients',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // List of ingredients
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Steps',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // List of steps
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Creating the AddRecipeScreen

The AddRecipeScreen allows users to input details for a new recipe, including the title, description, and image URL. This screen is essential for expanding the app's content and engaging users by letting them contribute their own recipes.

#### Functionality

- Provides a form for users to add new recipes.
- Validates user input to ensure data integrity.

#### Code Example

```dart
class AddRecipeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AddRecipeScreenState createState() => _AddRecipeScreenState();
}

class _AddRecipeScreenState extends State<AddRecipeScreen> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  final TextEditingController _titleController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _descriptionController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _imageUrlController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Add New Recipe')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Form(
          key: _formKey,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            child: Column(
              children: <Widget>[
                TextFormField(
                  controller: _titleController,
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Recipe Title'),
                  validator: (value) {
                    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                      return 'Please enter a title';
                    }
                    return null;
                  },
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 10),
                TextFormField(
                  controller: _descriptionController,
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Description'),
                  maxLines: 3,
                  validator: (value) {
                    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                      return 'Please enter a description';
                    }
                    return null;
                  },
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 10),
                TextFormField(
                  controller: _imageUrlController,
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Image URL'),
                  validator: (value) {
                    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                      return 'Please enter an image URL';
                    }
                    if (!Uri.parse(value).isAbsolute) {
                      return 'Please enter a valid URL';
                    }
                    return null;
                  },
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                      Recipe newRecipe = Recipe(
                        title: _titleController.text,
                        description: _descriptionController.text,
                        imageUrl: _imageUrlController.text,
                      );
                      // Add recipe to the list or database
                      Navigator.pop(context);
                    }
                  },
                  child: Text('Add Recipe'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _titleController.dispose();
    _descriptionController.dispose();
    _imageUrlController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

### Creating the FavoritesScreen

The FavoritesScreen displays a list of user-marked favorite recipes, allowing easy access and management. This screen enhances user engagement by providing a personalized experience.

#### Functionality

- Displays a list of favorite recipes.
- Allows users to view details of their favorite recipes.

#### Code Example

```dart
class FavoritesScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Recipe> favoriteRecipes = [
    // Pre-populated favorite recipes
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Favorites')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: favoriteRecipes.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            leading: Image.network(favoriteRecipes[index].imageUrl, width: 50, height: 50, fit: BoxFit.cover),
            title: Text(favoriteRecipes[index].title),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(
                context,
                '/detail',
                arguments: favoriteRecipes[index],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Visualizing Screen Relationships with Mermaid.js

To better understand the flow and relationship between different screens in our app, let's use a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Building Screens] --> B[Home Screen]
  A --> C[Recipe Detail Screen]
  A --> D[Add Recipe Screen]
  A --> E[Favorites Screen]
  A --> F[Settings Screen]
  
  B --> B1[Recipe List]
  B --> B2[Add Recipe Button]
  
  B1 --> B3[Navigate to Detail]
  B2 --> B4[Navigate to Add Recipe]
  
  D --> D1[Form Fields]
  D --> D2[Add Button]
  
  C --> C1[Display Recipe Details]
  
  E --> E2[Favorite Recipe List]
  
  F --> F1[App Settings]
```

### Integrating Screens with Navigation

Each screen in our Recipe App is designed to interact with the navigation system, allowing users to move seamlessly between different parts of the app. Here's how you can integrate these screens using Flutter's navigation capabilities:

- **HomeScreen**: Acts as the entry point, allowing navigation to the RecipeDetailScreen and AddRecipeScreen.
- **RecipeDetailScreen**: Receives data from the HomeScreen or FavoritesScreen and displays detailed information.
- **AddRecipeScreen**: Allows users to input new recipes and returns to the HomeScreen upon completion.
- **FavoritesScreen**: Provides quick access to favorite recipes and navigates to the RecipeDetailScreen for more information.

### Encouraging Customization and Exploration

As you become more comfortable with building and navigating between screens, consider customizing each screen further. Here are a few ideas to explore:

- **HomeScreen**: Implement search functionality to filter recipes.
- **RecipeDetailScreen**: Add a section for user reviews or ratings.
- **AddRecipeScreen**: Include fields for additional recipe details, such as cooking time or difficulty level.
- **FavoritesScreen**: Allow users to remove recipes from their favorites list.

By experimenting with these features, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Flutter's capabilities and how to create a dynamic, user-friendly app.

### Conclusion

Building screens in Flutter involves understanding the widget hierarchy and how to effectively use navigation to create a seamless user experience. By following the examples and instructions provided, you can create a robust Recipe App that showcases your skills in Flutter development. Remember to explore and customize the app further, as this is the best way to learn and grow as a developer.
