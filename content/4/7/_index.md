## 7 Navigation and Routing

Navigation and routing are essential components in Flutter applications, enabling users to move between different screens and interact with various parts of the app seamlessly. This chapter explores the fundamentals of navigation, the differences between single-screen and multi-screen apps, the use of navigators and routes, as well as implementing tabs and drawers. Through detailed explanations, practical code examples, and hands-on projects, you'll learn how to create intuitive and efficient navigation structures in your Flutter apps.

### 7.1 Single-Screen vs. Multi-Screen Apps

#### 7.1.1 Importance of Navigation

In the realm of mobile applications, navigation is the backbone of user interaction. It dictates how users move through the app, access features, and retrieve information. Effective navigation enhances user experience by providing a logical and intuitive path through the app's content.

- **User Experience:** Good navigation ensures that users can find what they need quickly and efficiently, reducing frustration and increasing satisfaction.
- **App Structure:** Navigation helps define the app's structure, organizing content into manageable sections.
- **Functionality Access:** It allows users to access different functionalities of the app without confusion.

#### 7.1.2 Flutter Navigation Basics

Flutter provides a robust navigation system that is both flexible and easy to use. At its core, Flutter's navigation is based on a stack, where each screen is a route pushed onto or popped off the stack.

- **Navigator:** The `Navigator` widget manages a stack of `Route` objects and provides methods for navigating between them.
- **Route:** A `Route` represents a screen or page in the app. Flutter provides several types of routes, including `MaterialPageRoute` for material design transitions.

Here's a simple example of pushing a new route onto the stack:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to navigate from one screen to another using `Navigator.push`.

#### 7.1.3 Named Routes

Named routes provide a way to define and manage routes centrally, making navigation more manageable, especially in larger applications.

- **Defining Named Routes:** Named routes are defined in the `MaterialApp` widget using the `routes` property.

```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/',
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
  },
);
```

- **Navigating with Named Routes:** Use `Navigator.pushNamed` to navigate to a named route.

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
```

Named routes simplify navigation by using string identifiers instead of direct references to widget constructors.

#### 7.1.4 Passing Data Between Screens

Passing data between screens is a common requirement in mobile apps. Flutter makes this process straightforward.

- **Passing Data:** Data can be passed to a new screen using the constructor of the screen widget.

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello from Home!'),
  ),
);
```

- **Receiving Data:** The receiving screen can access the data through its constructor parameters.

```dart
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String data;

  SecondScreen({required this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text(data)),
    );
  }
}
```

This approach allows for flexible data transfer between screens, enhancing the app's interactivity.

### 7.2 Navigators and Routes

#### 7.2.1 The Navigator Widget

The `Navigator` widget is a powerful tool for managing app navigation. It maintains a stack of routes and provides methods for manipulating this stack.

- **Pushing Routes:** Use `Navigator.push` to add a new route to the stack.
- **Popping Routes:** Use `Navigator.pop` to remove the top route from the stack.

Here's an example of popping a route:

```dart
Navigator.pop(context);
```

This command returns the user to the previous screen by removing the current route from the stack.

#### 7.2.2 Route Transitions

Flutter allows you to customize the transition animations between routes, providing a more engaging user experience.

- **Custom Transitions:** You can define custom transitions by creating a `PageRouteBuilder`.

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => SecondScreen(),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
      var begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
      var end = Offset.zero;
      var curve = Curves.ease;

      var tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end).chain(CurveTween(curve: curve));

      return SlideTransition(
        position: animation.drive(tween),
        child: child,
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

This example demonstrates a slide transition from the bottom of the screen.

#### 7.2.3 Dialogs and Bottom Sheets

Dialogs and bottom sheets are modal components that overlay part of the screen, providing additional context or options without navigating away from the current screen.

- **Dialogs:** Use `showDialog` to display a dialog.

```dart
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return AlertDialog(
      title: Text('Dialog Title'),
      content: Text('This is a simple dialog.'),
      actions: <Widget>[
        TextButton(
          child: Text('Close'),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
```

- **Bottom Sheets:** Use `showModalBottomSheet` for a bottom sheet.

```dart
showModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 200,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('This is a modal bottom sheet.'),
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

These components enhance user interaction by providing temporary, focused content.

#### 7.2.4 Deep Linking (Introduction)

Deep linking allows users to navigate directly to specific content within your app from external sources, such as web links or notifications.

- **URL Schemes:** Define custom URL schemes to handle deep links.
- **Handling Links:** Use the `uni_links` package to manage incoming links and navigate to the appropriate screen.

Deep linking is crucial for integrating your app with other platforms and improving user engagement.

### 7.3 Tabs and Drawers

#### 7.3.1 Using TabBar and TabBarView

Tabs provide a way to navigate between different sections of the app using a horizontal bar.

- **TabBar:** Displays the tabs.
- **TabBarView:** Displays the content for each tab.

Here's a basic example:

```dart
DefaultTabController(
  length: 3,
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      bottom: TabBar(
        tabs: [
          Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.directions_car)),
          Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.directions_transit)),
          Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.directions_bike)),
        ],
      ),
    ),
    body: TabBarView(
      children: [
        Icon(Icons.directions_car),
        Icon(Icons.directions_transit),
        Icon(Icons.directions_bike),
      ],
    ),
  ),
);
```

This setup creates a tabbed interface with three tabs.

#### 7.3.2 Drawer Navigation

Drawers provide a hidden side menu that can be revealed with a swipe or a tap on the menu icon.

- **Drawer Widget:** Use the `Drawer` widget to create a side menu.

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drawer Demo')),
  drawer: Drawer(
    child: ListView(
      padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
      children: <Widget>[
        DrawerHeader(
          child: Text('Drawer Header'),
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
        ListTile(
          title: Text('Item 1'),
          onTap: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
        ListTile(
          title: Text('Item 2'),
          onTap: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
  body: Center(child: Text('Swipe from left or tap the menu icon.')),
);
```

Drawers are ideal for apps with multiple sections or settings.

#### 7.3.3 Bottom Navigation Bars

Bottom navigation bars provide quick access to the app's primary sections.

- **BottomNavigationBar Widget:** Use this widget to create a bottom navigation bar.

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bottom Navigation Bar')),
  body: Center(child: Text('Home Screen')),
  bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
    items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.home),
        label: 'Home',
      ),
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.business),
        label: 'Business',
      ),
      BottomNavigationBarItem(
        icon: Icon(Icons.school),
        label: 'School',
      ),
    ],
    currentIndex: 0,
    selectedItemColor: Colors.amber[800],
    onTap: (index) {
      // Handle item tap
    },
  ),
);
```

Bottom navigation bars are suitable for apps with a few main sections.

#### 7.3.4 Combining Navigation Patterns

Combining different navigation patterns can create a more dynamic and user-friendly app.

- **Tabs and Drawers:** Use tabs for primary navigation and a drawer for secondary options.
- **Bottom Navigation and Stacks:** Combine bottom navigation with a stack of routes for deeper navigation.

Consider the app's structure and user needs when deciding on navigation patterns.

### 7.4 Hands-On Project: Recipe App with Multiple Screens

#### 7.4.1 Project Overview

In this hands-on project, you'll create a multi-screen recipe app that allows users to browse recipes, view details, and navigate between different sections using tabs and a drawer.

#### 7.4.2 Setting Up Routes

Define the routes for the app, including a home screen, a recipe list, and a recipe detail screen.

```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/',
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/recipes': (context) => RecipeListScreen(),
    '/recipeDetail': (context) => RecipeDetailScreen(),
  },
);
```

#### 7.4.3 Building Screens

Create the main screens for the app, including a list of recipes and a detailed view for each recipe.

```dart
class RecipeListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Recipes')),
      body: ListView(
        children: <Widget>[
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Recipe 1'),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/recipeDetail', arguments: 'Recipe 1');
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Recipe 2'),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/recipeDetail', arguments: 'Recipe 2');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RecipeDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final String recipeName = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as String;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(recipeName)),
      body: Center(child: Text('Details for $recipeName')),
    );
  }
}
```

#### 7.4.4 Implementing Navigation

Use a combination of tabs and a drawer to navigate between different sections of the app.

```dart
DefaultTabController(
  length: 2,
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Recipe App'),
      bottom: TabBar(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Home'),
          Tab(text: 'Recipes'),
        ],
      ),
    ),
    drawer: Drawer(
      child: ListView(
        padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
        children: <Widget>[
          DrawerHeader(
            child: Text('Menu'),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Home'),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/');
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            title: Text('Recipes'),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/recipes');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
    body: TabBarView(
      children: [
        Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Recipe App')),
        RecipeListScreen(),
      ],
    ),
  ),
);
```

This project demonstrates how to implement a cohesive navigation structure using multiple navigation patterns.
