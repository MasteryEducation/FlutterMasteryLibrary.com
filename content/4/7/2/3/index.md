## 7.2.3 Dialogs and Bottom Sheets

In the realm of mobile app development, user interaction is paramount. Flutter provides powerful tools to enhance this interaction through dialogs and bottom sheets. These components allow developers to present additional information or prompt user actions without navigating away from the current screen. This section delves into the creation, customization, and practical application of dialogs and bottom sheets in Flutter, empowering you to build more interactive and user-friendly apps.

### Introduction to Dialogs and Bottom Sheets

Dialogs and bottom sheets are modal interfaces that temporarily take over part of the screen to provide additional functionality. They are commonly used for:

- **Confirmations:** Asking users to confirm actions, such as deleting an item.
- **Forms:** Collecting user input without leaving the current context.
- **Settings Adjustments:** Allowing users to tweak settings in a focused manner.

These components are essential for maintaining a seamless user experience, as they allow users to interact with the app without losing their place in the navigation flow.

### Creating AlertDialogs

An `AlertDialog` is a simple yet effective way to prompt users for confirmation or provide notifications. It typically consists of a title, content, and a set of actions.

#### Code Example: Creating an AlertDialog

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Delete Task'),
        content: Text('Are you sure you want to delete this task?'),
        actions: <Widget>[
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Cancel'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Perform delete action
              Navigator.of(context).pop();
            },
            child: Text('Delete'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Delete Task'),
);
```

In this example, the `showDialog` function displays an `AlertDialog` with a title, content, and two actions: "Cancel" and "Delete". The `Navigator.of(context).pop()` method is used to dismiss the dialog.

### Creating Bottom Sheets

Bottom sheets are versatile components that slide up from the bottom of the screen. They come in two varieties: persistent and modal.

#### Persistent Bottom Sheet

A persistent bottom sheet remains visible while interacting with other parts of the app. It is ideal for displaying supplementary content that users might need to reference while performing other tasks.

##### Code Example: Persistent Bottom Sheet

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
  body: Center(
    child: ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        Scaffold.of(context).showBottomSheet<void>(
          (BuildContext context) {
            return Container(
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blueGrey,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'This is a persistent bottom sheet',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        );
      },
      child: Text('Show Persistent Bottom Sheet'),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In this code, `showBottomSheet` is used to display a persistent bottom sheet. The sheet remains on the screen, allowing users to interact with other UI elements.

#### Modal Bottom Sheet

A modal bottom sheet blocks interaction with other parts of the app until it is dismissed. This is useful for tasks that require focused user attention, such as filling out a form.

##### Code Example: Modal Bottom Sheet

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => Container(
        height: 200,
        color: Colors.lightBlue,
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'This is a modal bottom sheet',
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Show Modal Bottom Sheet'),
);
```

Here, `showModalBottomSheet` is used to present a modal bottom sheet. The user must dismiss the sheet to interact with the rest of the app.

### Customizing Dialogs and Bottom Sheets

Customization is key to making dialogs and bottom sheets fit seamlessly into your app's design. You can add custom content, such as forms or images, and style these components to match your app's theme.

#### Styling and Content Customization

You can enhance dialogs and bottom sheets by embedding forms, images, or any widget that suits your needs.

##### Code Example: AlertDialog with Form

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Add New Task'),
        content: TextField(
          controller: _taskController,
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Task Description'),
        ),
        actions: <Widget>[
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Cancel'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Provider.of<TaskProvider>(context, listen: false)
                  .addTask(_taskController.text);
              _taskController.clear();
              Navigator.of(context).pop();
            },
            child: Text('Add'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Add Task'),
);
```

This example demonstrates how to include a `TextField` within an `AlertDialog`, allowing users to input data directly into the dialog.

### Visualizing Dialogs and Bottom Sheets

To better understand the relationship between dialogs, bottom sheets, and their interactions, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid

  A[Dialogs and Bottom Sheets] --> B[AlertDialog]

This diagram illustrates the hierarchy and flow of dialogs and bottom sheets, highlighting their structures and interactions.

### Comprehensive Code Example

Below is a complete example that incorporates both dialogs and bottom sheets, showcasing how they can be used together in a Flutter app.

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController _taskController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('To-Do List App')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Add New Task'),
                    content: TextField(
                      controller: _taskController,
                      decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Task Description'),
                    ),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Cancel'),
                      ),
                      ElevatedButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          if (_taskController.text.isNotEmpty) {
                            Provider.of<TaskProvider>(context, listen: false)
                                .addTask(_taskController.text);
                            _taskController.clear();
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          }
                        },
                        child: Text('Add'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Add Task via Dialog'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                showModalBottomSheet(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => Container(
                    height: 200,
                    color: Colors.lightBlue,
                    child: Center(
                      child: Text(
                        'This is a modal bottom sheet',
                        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 18),
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Modal Bottom Sheet'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
