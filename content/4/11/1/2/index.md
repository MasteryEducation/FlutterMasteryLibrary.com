Future<void> saveThemePreference(bool isDarkMode) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setBool('isDarkMode', isDarkMode);
}

Future<bool> getThemePreference() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  return prefs.getBool('isDarkMode') ?? false;
}
```

  return openDatabase(
    join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'app_database.db'),
    onCreate: (db, version) {
      return db.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE users(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)",
      );
    },
    version: 1,
  );
}

Future<void> insertUser(Database db, User user) async {
  await db.insert(
    'users',
    user.toMap(),
    conflictAlgorithm: ConflictAlgorithm.replace,
  );
}
```

### Hive

Hive is a lightweight and high-performance key-value database that is particularly well-suited for Flutter applications. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice for developers looking for a simple yet powerful storage solution.

**Example Code:**

```dart
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';

void main() async {
  Hive.init('path_to_hive_boxes');
  var box = await Hive.openBox('settings');

  box.put('isDarkMode', true);

  bool isDarkMode = box.get('isDarkMode', defaultValue: false);
  print('Dark mode: $isDarkMode');
}
```

### Moor (Drift)

Moor, now known as Drift, is a reactive persistence library built on top of SQLite. It offers type-safe queries and ORM-like features, making it a powerful tool for managing structured data in Flutter applications.

  - Type-safe queries reduce runtime errors.

- **Limitations:**
  - Requires understanding of both SQL and the library's abstractions.
  - May introduce additional complexity compared to direct SQLite usage.

**Example Code:**

```dart
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
import 'package:drift/native.dart';

LazyDatabase _openConnection() {
  return LazyDatabase(() async {
    final db = NativeDatabase.memory();
    return db;
  });
}

@DriftDatabase(tables: [Users])
class MyDatabase extends _$MyDatabase {
  MyDatabase() : super(_openConnection());

  @override
  int get schemaVersion => 1;

  Future<List<User>> getAllUsers() => select(users).get();
}
```

### ObjectBox
