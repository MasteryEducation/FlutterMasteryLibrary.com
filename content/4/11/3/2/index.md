## 11.3.2 Using `sqflite` Package

In this section, we will delve into the integration of the `sqflite` package within a Flutter project to manage local databases effectively. The `sqflite` package is a popular choice for Flutter developers looking to implement SQLite databases in their applications. It provides a robust solution for data persistence, allowing you to store, retrieve, and manipulate structured data efficiently. This guide will walk you through setting up the database, creating tables, performing basic operations, and managing database versions and migrations.

### Adding the `sqflite` Package

To begin using `sqflite`, you need to add it to your Flutter project's dependencies. Additionally, the `path_provider` package is required to locate the database file path on the device.

#### Updating `pubspec.yaml`

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.0.0+4
  path_provider: ^2.0.11
  path: ^1.8.2
```

After updating the file, run the following command to install the packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Importing Necessary Libraries

Once the packages are installed, you need to import the necessary libraries in your Dart files to perform database operations.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';
```

### Initializing the Database

The first step in working with a local database is to initialize it. This involves creating or opening a database file on the device.

#### Using `getDatabasesPath` and `openDatabase`

The `getDatabasesPath` function helps in locating the directory for storing the database file, while `openDatabase` is used to open or create the database.

```dart
class DatabaseHelper {
  static final DatabaseHelper _instance = DatabaseHelper._internal();
  factory DatabaseHelper() => _instance;
  DatabaseHelper._internal();

  static Database? _database;

  Future<Database> get database async {
    if (_database != null) return _database!;
    _database = await _initDatabase();
    return _database!;
  }

  Future<Database> _initDatabase() async {
    Directory documentsDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    String path = join(documentsDirectory.path, 'app.db');
    return await openDatabase(
      path,
      version: 1,
      onCreate: _onCreate,
      onUpgrade: _onUpgrade,
    );
  }
}
```

### Creating Tables

Once the database is initialized, you can create tables to store your data. This is done using SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements.

#### Executing SQL `CREATE TABLE` Statements

Define the structure of your tables by specifying the columns, data types, and primary keys.

```dart
Future _onCreate(Database db, int version) async {
  await db.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE users(
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      age INTEGER
    )
  ''');
}
```

### Managing Database Versions

As your application evolves, you may need to update the database schema. This requires handling database versions and migrations.

#### Implementing Versioning to Handle Schema Changes

Specify the database version in the `openDatabase` function. Use the `onUpgrade` callback to manage schema changes.

```dart
Future _onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (oldVersion < newVersion) {
    // Handle migrations here
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

When working with local databases, it's important to follow best practices to ensure efficient and reliable data management.

#### Structuring Database Helper Classes

Encapsulate database operations within a helper class to promote code reusability and maintainability.

#### Ensuring Thread Safety and Managing Asynchronous Operations

Database operations can be time-consuming, so it's crucial to handle them asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI thread.

### Code Example

Here's a complete example of a database helper class that initializes the database, creates a table, and manages versions:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class DatabaseHelper {
  static final DatabaseHelper _instance = DatabaseHelper._internal();
  factory DatabaseHelper() => _instance;
  DatabaseHelper._internal();

  static Database? _database;

  Future<Database> get database async {
    if (_database != null) return _database!;
    _database = await _initDatabase();
    return _database!;
  }

  Future<Database> _initDatabase() async {
    Directory documentsDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    String path = join(documentsDirectory.path, 'app.db');
    return await openDatabase(
      path,
      version: 1,
      onCreate: _onCreate,
      onUpgrade: _onUpgrade,
    );
  }

  Future _onCreate(Database db, int version) async {
    await db.execute('''
      CREATE TABLE users(
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        age INTEGER
      )
    ''');
  }

  Future _onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
    if (oldVersion < newVersion) {
      // Handle migrations here
    }
  }
}
```

### Practical Example: User Management

Let's consider a practical example where you manage user data in your application. You can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the `sqflite` package.

#### Creating a User

To insert a new user into the database, use the `insert` method.

```dart
Future<int> insertUser(Map<String, dynamic> user) async {
  final db = await database;
  return await db.insert('users', user);
}
```

#### Reading Users

To retrieve users from the database, use the `query` method.

```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getUsers() async {
  final db = await database;
  return await db.query('users');
}
```

#### Updating a User

To update user information, use the `update` method.

```dart
Future<int> updateUser(Map<String, dynamic> user) async {
  final db = await database;
  return await db.update(
    'users',
    user,
    where: 'id = ?',
    whereArgs: [user['id']],
  );
}
```

#### Deleting a User

To remove a user from the database, use the `delete` method.

```dart
Future<int> deleteUser(int id) async {
  final db = await database;
  return await db.delete(
    'users',
    where: 'id = ?',
    whereArgs: [id],
  );
}
```

### Handling Database Migrations

As your application grows, you may need to modify the database schema. This requires careful handling of migrations to ensure data integrity.

#### Using the `onUpgrade` Callback

The `onUpgrade` callback is triggered when the database version is incremented. Use this callback to apply schema changes.

```dart
Future _onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (oldVersion < newVersion) {
    await db.execute('ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email TEXT');
  }
}
```

### Ensuring Data Integrity

Maintaining data integrity is crucial when working with databases. Here are some strategies to ensure your data remains consistent and reliable:

- **Use Transactions:** Group multiple operations into a single transaction to ensure atomicity.
- **Validate Data:** Implement validation checks before inserting or updating data.
- **Handle Exceptions:** Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and prevent crashes.

### Conclusion

Integrating the `sqflite` package into your Flutter project provides a powerful solution for managing local databases. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can set up a robust database system that supports data persistence, retrieval, and manipulation. Remember to adhere to best practices, handle migrations carefully, and ensure data integrity throughout your application's lifecycle.
