## 8.4.4 Authenticating Users

In this section, we will delve into implementing user authentication for your Notes App using Firebase. Authentication is crucial for ensuring that each user's notes are secure and private. By the end of this chapter, you will have a fully functional authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their notes securely.

### Overview

User authentication is a fundamental aspect of modern applications, providing a secure way to manage user access and data. In this project, we will use Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-up and login processes. Additionally, we will integrate Firestore to store notes specific to authenticated users, ensuring that each user's data is isolated and secure.

### Setting Up Firebase Authentication

Before diving into the implementation, ensure that your Firebase project is set up and integrated with your Flutter app. If you haven't done this yet, refer to the earlier section on setting up Firebase.

#### Adding Firebase Authentication to Your Project

1. **Add Firebase Authentication Package**: First, include the Firebase Authentication package in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     firebase_auth: ^3.1.6
     cloud_firestore: ^3.1.6
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase**: Ensure Firebase is initialized in your `main.dart` file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Firebase.initializeApp();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

### Creating Authentication UI

The first step in implementing authentication is to create the user interface for sign-up and login forms. These forms will allow users to enter their credentials and access their notes.

#### Sign-Up Form

Create a simple sign-up form where users can enter their email and password to create an account.

```dart
class SignUpScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SignUpScreenState createState() => _SignUpScreenState();
}

class _SignUpScreenState extends State<SignUpScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  final AuthService _authService = AuthService();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sign Up')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                User? user = await _authService.signUp(
                  _emailController.text,
                  _passwordController.text,
                );
                if (user != null) {
                  // Navigate to the notes screen
                }
              },
              child: Text('Sign Up'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Login Form

Similarly, create a login form for existing users to access their accounts.

```dart
class LoginScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoginScreenState createState() => _LoginScreenState();
}

class _LoginScreenState extends State<LoginScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  final AuthService _authService = AuthService();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Login')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                User? user = await _authService.signIn(
                  _emailController.text,
                  _passwordController.text,
                );
                if (user != null) {
                  // Navigate to the notes screen
                }
              },
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Implementing Firebase Authentication Logic

With the UI in place, the next step is to implement the logic for handling user authentication using Firebase.

#### AuthService Class

Create an `AuthService` class to encapsulate the authentication logic. This class will handle sign-up, login, and sign-out operations.

```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';

class AuthService {
  final FirebaseAuth _auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;

  // Sign up with email and password
  Future<User?> signUp(String email, String password) async {
    try {
      UserCredential result = await _auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
          email: email, password: password);
      return result.user;
    } catch (e) {
      print(e);
      return null;
    }
  }

  // Sign in with email and password
  Future<User?> signIn(String email, String password) async {
    try {
      UserCredential result = await _auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
          email: email, password: password);
      return result.user;
    } catch (e) {
      print(e);
      return null;
    }
  }

  // Sign out
  Future<void> signOut() async {
    await _auth.signOut();
  }

  // Auth state changes
  Stream<User?> get user {
    return _auth.authStateChanges();
  }
}
```

### Managing User Sessions and Authentication States

Handling user sessions and authentication states is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. You can use the `authStateChanges` stream to listen for changes in the authentication state and update the UI accordingly.

#### Listening to Authentication State

In your main widget, listen to the authentication state to determine whether to show the login screen or the notes screen.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<User?>(
      stream: AuthService().user,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.active) {
          User? user = snapshot.data;
          if (user == null) {
            return MaterialApp(home: LoginScreen());
          }
          return MaterialApp(home: NotesScreen());
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Associating Notes with Authenticated Users in Firestore

To ensure that notes are user-specific, store each user's notes in a sub-collection within their user document in Firestore.

#### Adding Notes to Firestore

When a user adds a note, save it under their user ID in Firestore.

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

Future<void> addUserNote(String userId, Note note) async {
  await FirebaseFirestore.instance
      .collection('users')
      .doc(userId)
      .collection('notes')
      .add(note.toMap());
}
```

#### Retrieving User-Specific Notes

Fetch notes for the authenticated user by querying their specific sub-collection.

```dart
Stream<List<Note>> getUserNotes(String userId) {
  return FirebaseFirestore.instance
      .collection('users')
      .doc(userId)
      .collection('notes')
      .snapshots()
      .map((snapshot) => snapshot.docs
          .map((doc) => Note.fromMap(doc.id, doc.data()))
          .toList());
}
```

### Practical Example: Secure Notes App

Let's put everything together in a practical example. We'll create a simple notes app where users can sign up, log in, and manage their notes securely.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Firebase**: Ensure Firebase is initialized in your app.
2. **Create Authentication UI**: Implement sign-up and login forms.
3. **Implement AuthService**: Handle authentication logic using Firebase.
4. **Manage Authentication State**: Use streams to manage user sessions.
5. **Store Notes in Firestore**: Save and retrieve user-specific notes.

### Diagram: Authentication Flow

Here's a visual representation of the authentication flow in your app:
