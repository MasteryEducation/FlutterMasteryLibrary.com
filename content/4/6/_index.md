## 6 State Management Basics

State management is a crucial aspect of Flutter development, enabling developers to handle and maintain the state of their applications efficiently. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of state management, explores various techniques, and guides you through building a practical **To-Do List App** to apply what you've learned.

### 6.1 Understanding State

#### 6.1.1 What Is State?

In the context of Flutter, "state" refers to any data that can change over time. This includes user inputs, fetched data, or any variable that affects the UI. Managing state effectively is essential for creating responsive and dynamic applications.

- **State**: Represents the mutable data in your app. It can change in response to user actions or network events.
- **UI State**: The visual representation of the state. When the state changes, the UI should update to reflect these changes.

#### 6.1.2 Stateful vs. Stateless Widgets Revisited

Flutter applications are built using widgets, which can be either stateful or stateless.

- **Stateless Widgets**: These widgets do not store any state. They are immutable and are rebuilt every time they need to be displayed. Use them when the UI does not change dynamically.

  ```dart
  class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Text('I am a stateless widget');
    }
  }
  ```

- **Stateful Widgets**: These widgets can store state and are mutable. They can change dynamically based on user interaction or other events.

  ```dart
  class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
  }

  class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
    int _counter = 0;

    void _incrementCounter() {
      setState(() {
        _counter++;
      });
    }

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Column(
        children: [
          Text('Counter: $_counter'),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _incrementCounter,
            child: Text('Increment'),
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
  }
  ```

#### 6.1.3 Lifecycle of Stateful Widgets

Understanding the lifecycle of stateful widgets is crucial for managing state effectively. The lifecycle consists of several stages:

- **createState()**: Called when the widget is first created. It returns an instance of the State class.
- **initState()**: Invoked when the state object is created. Use it to initialize data.
- **build()**: Called whenever the widget needs to be rendered.
- **setState()**: Triggers a rebuild of the widget, updating the UI to reflect changes in state.
- **dispose()**: Called when the widget is removed from the widget tree. Use it to clean up resources.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[createState()] --> B[initState()];
    B --> C[build()];
    C --> D[setState()];
    D --> C;
    C --> E[dispose()];
```

#### 6.1.4 setState Method

The `setState` method is pivotal in updating the UI in response to state changes. It notifies the framework that the state has changed, prompting a rebuild of the widget.

- **Usage**: Call `setState` within a stateful widget to update the UI.

  ```dart
  void _updateState() {
    setState(() {
      // Update state variables here
    });
  }
  ```

### 6.2 Lifting State Up

#### 6.2.1 Propagating State Changes

In Flutter, it's common to share state between widgets. This is often achieved by "lifting state up" to a common ancestor widget that manages the state and passes it down to child widgets.

- **Example**: If two sibling widgets need to share state, lift the state to their parent widget and pass it down as needed.

#### 6.2.2 Passing Data Through Constructors

Data can be passed between widgets using constructors. This is a straightforward way to share state between parent and child widgets.

```dart
class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String data = 'Hello from Parent';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChildWidget(data: data);
  }
}

class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String data;

  ChildWidget({required this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(data);
  }
}
```

#### 6.2.3 Callbacks and Event Handlers

Callbacks are functions passed from parent to child widgets to handle events or actions. They allow child widgets to communicate with their parents.

- **Example**: A button in a child widget can trigger a function in the parent widget.

```dart
class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  void _handleButtonPress() {
    print('Button pressed in child widget');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChildWidget(onPressed: _handleButtonPress);
  }
}

class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  ChildWidget({required this.onPressed});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text('Press me'),
    );
  }
}
```

#### 6.2.4 Inherited Widgets (Introduction)

Inherited widgets provide a way to efficiently propagate state down the widget tree. They are particularly useful for sharing state with many descendant widgets.

- **Usage**: Define an inherited widget that holds the state and use `of(context)` to access it from descendant widgets.

```dart
class MyInheritedWidget extends InheritedWidget {
  final int data;

  MyInheritedWidget({required this.data, required Widget child}) : super(child: child);

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(MyInheritedWidget oldWidget) {
    return oldWidget.data != data;
  }

  static MyInheritedWidget? of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedWidget>();
  }
}
```

### 6.3 Simple State Management Techniques

#### 6.3.1 Using Provider Package

The Provider package is a popular choice for state management in Flutter. It offers a simple and efficient way to manage state across your application.

- **Setup**: Add the Provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    provider: ^6.0.0
  ```

- **Usage**: Wrap your widget tree with a `ChangeNotifierProvider` and use `Consumer` or `Provider.of` to access the state.

```dart
class Counter with ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => Counter(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final counter = Provider.of<Counter>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Count: ${counter.count}'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: counter.increment,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### 6.3.2 ScopedModel (Overview)

ScopedModel is another state management solution that provides a simple way to manage state across your app. It is less commonly used than Provider but still effective for smaller applications.

- **Setup**: Add the ScopedModel package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    scoped_model: ^1.0.1
  ```

- **Usage**: Define a model class extending `Model`, and use `ScopedModel` and `ScopedModelDescendant` to provide and access the model.

```dart
class CounterModel extends Model {
  int _counter = 0;

  int get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    _counter++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ScopedModel<CounterModel>(
      model: CounterModel(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScopedModelDescendant<CounterModel>(
      builder: (context, child, model) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
          body: Center(
            child: Text('Counter: ${model.counter}'),
          ),
          floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: model.increment,
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

#### 6.3.3 When to Use Which Technique

Choosing the right state management technique depends on the complexity and requirements of your application.

- **Provider**: Suitable for most applications due to its simplicity and flexibility.
- **ScopedModel**: Good for smaller apps or when you prefer a simpler approach.
- **InheritedWidget**: Useful for sharing state with many descendant widgets without external packages.

#### 6.3.4 Best Practices

- **Keep State Localized**: Only lift state up when necessary.
- **Avoid Overusing setState**: Use it judiciously to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.
- **Use Immutable Data**: Prefer immutable data structures to avoid unintended side effects.
- **Optimize Performance**: Use `Consumer` or `Selector` to minimize widget rebuilds in Provider.

### 6.4 Hands-On Project: To-Do List App

#### 6.4.1 Project Overview

In this project, you'll build a simple To-Do List App to practice state management techniques. The app will allow users to add, update, and remove tasks.

#### 6.4.2 Designing the UI

Start by designing a basic UI for the To-Do List App. The app will consist of a list of tasks and a form to add new tasks.

- **Task List**: Display tasks using a `ListView`.
- **Add Task Form**: Use a `TextField` and a button to add new tasks.

#### 6.4.3 Implementing State Changes

Use the Provider package to manage the state of the tasks.

1. **Define a Task Model**:

```dart
class Task {
  String title;
  bool isCompleted;

  Task({required this.title, this.isCompleted = false});
}
```

2. **Create a TaskProvider**:

```dart
class TaskProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  List<Task> _tasks = [];

  List<Task> get tasks => _tasks;

  void addTask(String title) {
    _tasks.add(Task(title: title));
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void toggleTaskCompletion(int index) {
    _tasks[index].isCompleted = !_tasks[index].isCompleted;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void removeTask(int index) {
    _tasks.removeAt(index);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

3. **Setup the Provider**:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => TaskProvider(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

4. **Build the UI**:

```dart
class ToDoListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final taskProvider = Provider.of<TaskProvider>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('To-Do List')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: taskProvider.tasks.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final task = taskProvider.tasks[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(task.title),
                  trailing: Checkbox(
                    value: task.isCompleted,
                    onChanged: (value) {
                      taskProvider.toggleTaskCompletion(index);
                    },
                  ),
                  onLongPress: () {
                    taskProvider.removeTask(index);
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Row(
              children: [
                Expanded(
                  child: TextField(
                    controller: _controller,
                    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Add a task'),
                  ),
                ),
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.add),
                  onPressed: () {
                    if (_controller.text.isNotEmpty) {
                      taskProvider.addTask(_controller.text);
                      _controller.clear();
                    }
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### 6.4.4 Persisting Data Temporarily

For this project, data persistence is not implemented, but you can extend the app to use local storage solutions like Shared Preferences or SQLite to save tasks between sessions.
