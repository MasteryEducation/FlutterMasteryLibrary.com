## 6.3.2 ScopedModel (Overview)

State management is a crucial aspect of building dynamic and responsive applications in Flutter. Among the various state management solutions available, **ScopedModel** stands out as an early approach inspired by the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. Although it has been largely superseded by more advanced solutions like Provider, understanding ScopedModel provides a solid foundation for grasping the principles of state management in Flutter.

### Introduction to ScopedModel

**ScopedModel** is a lightweight state management library for Flutter that allows you to manage and share state across your application. It is particularly useful for smaller projects or for developers who are just beginning to explore state management concepts. ScopedModel simplifies the process of propagating state changes throughout the widget tree, ensuring that your UI remains in sync with your application's data.

#### Key Concepts of ScopedModel

- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture:** ScopedModel draws inspiration from MVVM, where the Model represents the data and business logic, the View is the UI, and the ViewModel acts as an intermediary that holds the state and exposes it to the View.
- **Centralized State Management:** ScopedModel allows you to centralize your application's state in a single model, making it easier to manage and update.
- **Listener Notification:** When the state changes, ScopedModel notifies all registered listeners, ensuring that the UI updates automatically.

### Installing ScopedModel

To get started with ScopedModel, you need to add it to your Flutter project. This involves updating your `pubspec.yaml` file and fetching the package.

#### Add ScopedModel to `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scoped_model: ^1.1.0
```

#### Fetch the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to download and install the ScopedModel package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Setting Up ScopedModel

Once ScopedModel is installed, you can set it up in your Flutter application by wrapping your root widget with a `ScopedModel` widget. This provides the model to the entire widget tree, allowing any descendant widget to access and react to state changes.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ScopedModel<CounterModel>(
      model: CounterModel(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Creating a Model

In ScopedModel, a model is a class that extends `Model`. This class holds the state and provides methods to modify it. When the state changes, the model notifies all listeners, prompting the UI to update.

```dart
class CounterModel extends Model {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **State Variables:** The `_count` variable holds the state. It is private to prevent direct modification from outside the model.
- **Getters:** The `count` getter provides read-only access to the state.
- **State Modification Methods:** The `increment` method modifies the state and calls `notifyListeners()` to update the UI.

### Consuming ScopedModel Data

To access and react to state changes, use the `ScopedModelDescendant` widget. This widget listens for changes in the model and rebuilds its subtree when the state updates.

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ScopedModel Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ScopedModelDescendant<CounterModel>(
          builder: (context, child, model) => Text(
            'Count: ${model.count}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => ScopedModel.of<CounterModel>(context).increment(),
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **ScopedModelDescendant:** This widget rebuilds its subtree whenever the model notifies listeners of a state change.
- **Builder Function:** The builder function provides access to the model, allowing you to read the state and update the UI accordingly.
- **State Modification:** The `FloatingActionButton` uses `ScopedModel.of<CounterModel>(context)` to access the model and call the `increment` method.

### Visualizing ScopedModel with Mermaid.js

To better understand the flow of ScopedModel, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[ScopedModel] --> B[Add ScopedModel to pubspec.yaml]
  A --> C[Create Model]
  C --> D[Define State and Methods]
  C --> E[Notify Listeners]
  A --> F[Wrap Root with ScopedModel]
  F --> G[ScopedModel Widget]
  
  A --> H[Consume ScopedModel Data]
  H --> H1[ScopedModelDescendant Widget]
  H --> H2[ScopedModel.of Method]
  
  H1 --> I[Access State Data]
  H2 --> I
```

### Limitations of ScopedModel

While ScopedModel provides a straightforward approach to state management, it has several limitations that have led to its decline in popularity:

- **Less Flexible:** ScopedModel lacks the flexibility and features of more modern solutions like Provider, which offers better support for complex use cases.
- **Obsolete for New Projects:** Due to its limited capabilities and the broader adoption of Provider, ScopedModel is not recommended for new projects. However, it remains a valuable learning tool for understanding the basics of state management.

### Conclusion

ScopedModel serves as an excellent introduction to state management in Flutter, offering a simple yet effective way to manage and share state across your application. While it may not be suitable for larger or more complex projects, it provides foundational knowledge that can be applied to more advanced state management solutions.

By understanding ScopedModel, you gain insight into the principles of state management, preparing you to explore more sophisticated patterns and libraries like Provider. As you continue your journey in Flutter development, consider experimenting with different state management techniques to find the one that best suits your project's needs.
