## 6.4.4 Persisting Data Temporarily

In the realm of mobile app development, ensuring that data persists across different states of an application is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. This section delves into the concept of persisting data temporarily in Flutter applications, focusing on maintaining state during app sessions and optionally extending persistence beyond sessions using local storage solutions like `shared_preferences`.

### Introduction to Data Persistence

Data persistence refers to the ability of an application to retain data across different states and sessions. In the context of our To-Do List App, persisting data temporarily means ensuring that the list of tasks remains visible and intact during the app's runtime. This is essential for user experience, as it allows users to continue their tasks without losing progress when navigating through the app or when the app is temporarily closed.

#### Why Persist Data Temporarily?

- **User Experience:** Users expect their data to remain consistent as they interact with the app. Losing data between sessions can lead to frustration.
- **State Consistency:** Maintaining state consistency ensures that the app behaves predictably, which is vital for debugging and further development.
- **Performance:** Temporary persistence can reduce the need for frequent data fetching, improving app performance.

### Using Provider to Persist Data

Provider is a popular state management solution in Flutter that helps manage and propagate state changes throughout the app. By using Provider, we can ensure that our task list remains consistent during the app's runtime.

#### Implementing Provider for State Management

Provider allows us to manage the state of our application efficiently. Here's how we can use it to manage our task list:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class TaskProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<Task> _tasks = [];

  List<Task> get tasks => _tasks;

  void addTask(String description) {
    _tasks.add(Task(description: description));
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void deleteTask(int index) {
    _tasks.removeAt(index);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void updateTask(int index, String newDescription) {
    _tasks[index].description = newDescription;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void toggleTaskCompletion(int index) {
    _tasks[index].isCompleted = !_tasks[index].isCompleted;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

class Task {
  String description;
  bool isCompleted;

  Task({required this.description, this.isCompleted = false});
}
```

- **State Management:** The `TaskProvider` class extends `ChangeNotifier`, allowing it to notify listeners whenever the state changes.
- **Task Operations:** Methods like `addTask`, `deleteTask`, `updateTask`, and `toggleTaskCompletion` modify the task list and trigger UI updates.

### Persisting Data Locally with shared_preferences (Optional)

While Provider helps manage state during the app's runtime, `shared_preferences` can be used to persist data beyond the app session. This means that even if the app is closed and reopened, the data remains intact.

#### Installing shared_preferences

To use `shared_preferences`, we need to add it to our project dependencies.

**Add to `pubspec.yaml`:**

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider: ^6.0.5
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.15
```

**Run `flutter pub get`** to fetch the package.

#### Saving Tasks Locally

To save tasks locally, we need to serialize our task data into a format that can be stored in `shared_preferences`, such as JSON.

**Code Example:**

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class TaskProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<Task> _tasks = [];

  List<Task> get tasks => _tasks;

  TaskProvider() {
    _loadTasks();
  }

  void addTask(String description) {
    _tasks.add(Task(description: description));
    notifyListeners();
    _saveTasks();
  }

  void deleteTask(int index) {
    _tasks.removeAt(index);
    notifyListeners();
    _saveTasks();
  }

  void updateTask(int index, String newDescription) {
    _tasks[index].description = newDescription;
    notifyListeners();
    _saveTasks();
  }

  void toggleTaskCompletion(int index) {
    _tasks[index].isCompleted = !_tasks[index].isCompleted;
    notifyListeners();
    _saveTasks();
  }

  Future<void> _saveTasks() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    List<String> taskList = _tasks.map((task) => jsonEncode(task.toJson())).toList();
    await prefs.setStringList('tasks', taskList);
  }

  Future<void> _loadTasks() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    List<String>? taskList = prefs.getStringList('tasks');
    if (taskList != null) {
      _tasks = taskList.map((task) => Task.fromJson(jsonDecode(task))).toList();
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}

class Task {
  String description;
  bool isCompleted;

  Task({required this.description, this.isCompleted = false});

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
        'description': description,
        'isCompleted': isCompleted,
      };

  factory Task.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Task(
      description: json['description'],
      isCompleted: json['isCompleted'],
    );
  }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Serialization:** The `Task` class includes `toJson` and `fromJson` methods to convert task objects to and from JSON format.
- **Saving to SharedPreferences:** The `_saveTasks` method converts the list of tasks to a list of JSON strings and stores it in `shared_preferences`.
- **Loading Tasks on Initialization:** The `_loadTasks` method retrieves the stored tasks from `shared_preferences` and deserializes them back into `Task` objects when the provider is initialized.

### Visualizing Data Persistence Flow

To better understand the flow of data persistence from state management to local storage, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Persisting Data Temporarily] --> B[Provider State]
  A --> C[Local Storage]
  
  B --> B1[State Consistency]
  C --> C1[shared_preferences]
  C1 --> C2[Save Tasks]
  C1 --> C3[Load Tasks]
  
  B --> D[Notify Listeners]
  C2 --> D
  C3 --> D
```

- **Provider State:** Manages the application's runtime state, ensuring consistency.
- **Local Storage:** Uses `shared_preferences` to save and load tasks, extending persistence beyond sessions.
- **Notify Listeners:** Updates the UI whenever tasks are added, removed, or modified.

### Best Practices

- **Data Serialization:** Always ensure that data is properly serialized before storing and deserialized after retrieval to maintain data integrity.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data loading and saving processes to prevent crashes and data loss.
- **Performance Considerations:** Avoid saving large amounts of data frequently to maintain app performance. Consider batching updates or using more efficient storage solutions for larger datasets.

### Conclusion

Persisting data temporarily is a crucial aspect of app development that enhances user experience by maintaining state consistency. By leveraging Provider for state management and `shared_preferences` for local storage, developers can ensure that their Flutter applications provide a seamless and reliable user experience. As you implement these techniques, remember to follow best practices and consider the specific needs of your application to choose the most appropriate data persistence strategy.
