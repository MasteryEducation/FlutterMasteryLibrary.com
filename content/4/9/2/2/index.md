## 9.2.2 Sending Requests

In the world of mobile app development, interacting with web services is a common requirement. Whether you're fetching data from a server, submitting user information, or updating resources, understanding how to send HTTP requests is crucial. In this section, we'll explore how to construct and send various types of HTTP requests using the `http` package in Flutter. We'll cover GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, discuss setting headers, sending request bodies, and managing query parameters. By the end of this section, you'll be equipped to handle network communication in your Flutter apps effectively.

### Understanding HTTP Requests

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines methods to interact with resources, such as:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create a resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource on a server.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from a server.

Each request type serves a specific purpose and requires different handling in terms of headers, body, and parameters.

### Setting Up the `http` Package

Before diving into code examples, ensure you have the `http` package added to your Flutter project. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Crafting GET Requests with Query Parameters

GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server. They can include query parameters to filter or modify the data returned.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

Future<void> fetchUsers(String query) async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users?search=$query'));
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final List<dynamic> users = json.decode(response.body);
    // Process the list of users
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to fetch users');
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **URI Parsing**: Use `Uri.parse` to construct the URL with query parameters.
- **Status Code Handling**: Check the `statusCode` to determine if the request was successful.
- **JSON Decoding**: Use `json.decode` to parse the response body.

### Sending POST Requests with JSON Bodies

POST requests are used to send data to a server, typically to create a new resource. They often include a JSON body.

```dart
Future<void> createUser(String name, String email) async {
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'},
    body: json.encode({'name': name, 'email': email}),
  );
  if (response.statusCode == 201) {
    print('User created!');
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to create user');
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Headers**: Set `Content-Type` to `application/json` to indicate the body format.
- **JSON Encoding**: Use `json.encode` to convert Dart objects to JSON strings.
- **Status Code 201**: Indicates successful creation of a resource.

### Using PUT/PATCH for Updating Resources

PUT requests are used to update existing resources. They require the resource's identifier and a JSON body with updated data.

```dart
Future<void> updateUser(int id, String name, String email) async {
  final response = await http.put(
    Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users/$id'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'},
    body: json.encode({'name': name, 'email': email}),
  );
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('User updated!');
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to update user');
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Resource Identification**: Include the resource ID in the URL.
- **PUT vs. PATCH**: Use PUT for full updates and PATCH for partial updates.
- **Status Code 200**: Indicates successful update.

### Executing DELETE Requests

DELETE requests are used to remove resources from a server. They typically require the resource's identifier.

```dart
Future<void> deleteUser(int id) async {
  final response = await http.delete(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/users/$id'));
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('User deleted!');
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to delete user');
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Resource Identification**: Include the resource ID in the URL.
- **Status Code 200**: Indicates successful deletion.

### Setting Custom Headers

Custom headers are often required for authentication, content negotiation, or other purposes. You can set headers in any HTTP request.

```dart
Future<void> fetchProtectedData() async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/protected'),
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'},
  );
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Process protected data
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to fetch protected data');
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Authorization**: Use headers to pass authentication tokens.
- **Content Negotiation**: Specify `Accept` headers to request specific data formats.

### Practical Example: User Management

Let's consider a practical example where we manage user data using the above HTTP methods. We'll create a simple Dart class to encapsulate these operations.

```dart
class UserService {
  final String baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com/users';

  Future<List<dynamic>> fetchUsers(String query) async {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('$baseUrl?search=$query'));
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      return json.decode(response.body);
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to fetch users');
    }
  }

  Future<void> createUser(String name, String email) async {
    final response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse(baseUrl),
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'},
      body: json.encode({'name': name, 'email': email}),
    );
    if (response.statusCode != 201) {
      throw Exception('Failed to create user');
    }
  }

  Future<void> updateUser(int id, String name, String email) async {
    final response = await http.put(
      Uri.parse('$baseUrl/$id'),
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'},
      body: json.encode({'name': name, 'email': email}),
    );
    if (response.statusCode != 200) {
      throw Exception('Failed to update user');
    }
  }

  Future<void> deleteUser(int id) async {
    final response = await http.delete(Uri.parse('$baseUrl/$id'));
    if (response.statusCode != 200) {
      throw Exception('Failed to delete user');
    }
  }
}
```

### Diagram: HTTP Request Flow

Below is a visual representation of how different HTTP requests interact with a server.

    A --> E[DELETE Request]
    B --> F[Retrieve Data]
    C --> G[Create Resource]
    D --> H[Update Resource]
    E --> I[Delete Resource]
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Error Handling**: Always check the `statusCode` and handle errors gracefully.
- **Timeouts**: Set timeouts for requests to avoid hanging indefinitely.
- **Security**: Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys in your code.
- **Data Validation**: Validate data before sending it to the server to prevent errors.
