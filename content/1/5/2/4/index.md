## 5.2.4 Deep Linking

In the world of mobile app development, deep linking is a powerful feature that enhances user experience by allowing external sources, such as URLs, to direct users to specific content within an app. This capability is crucial for apps that aim to provide seamless navigation and integration with web content. In this section, we will delve into the concept of deep linking, explore its types, and guide you through implementing it in a Flutter application.

### What is Deep Linking?

Deep linking refers to the practice of using a hyperlink to direct users to a specific location within a mobile application. Unlike standard links that open a website, deep links can open an app directly if it is installed on the user's device. This feature is particularly useful for marketing campaigns, social media promotions, and personalized user experiences, as it allows users to bypass the app's home screen and navigate directly to the content they are interested in.

### Types of Deep Linking

There are several types of deep linking, each serving different purposes and offering varying levels of integration with mobile operating systems.

#### Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android)

Universal Links and App Links are the most robust forms of deep linking. They allow a single URL to open either the app or the corresponding website, depending on whether the app is installed on the device.

- **Universal Links (iOS):** These links work seamlessly with iOS devices. When a user taps a Universal Link, iOS checks if the app is installed. If it is, the app opens directly to the specified content. If not, the link opens in Safari.

- **App Links (Android):** Similar to Universal Links, App Links on Android provide a way to open the app directly from a URL. If the app is not installed, the link opens in the default web browser.

#### Custom URL Schemes

Custom URL Schemes are app-specific protocols that allow apps to define their own URL schemes. For example, an app might use a URL like `myapp://page` to open a specific page within the app. While this method is simpler to implement, it lacks the flexibility and security of Universal and App Links.

### Implementing Deep Linking in Flutter

Implementing deep linking in a Flutter app involves several steps, including setting up URL handling, listening for incoming links, and navigating based on the link data. We will use the `uni_links` package, which provides a straightforward way to handle deep links in Flutter.

#### Using the `uni_links` Package

The `uni_links` package is a popular choice for handling deep links in Flutter. It supports both Universal Links and Custom URL Schemes, making it versatile for different use cases.

**Adding `uni_links` to `pubspec.yaml`:**

To get started, add the `uni_links` package to your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uni_links: ^0.5.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Setting Up URL Handling

Configuring your app to handle deep links requires changes to the platform-specific files for both Android and iOS.

**Android Configuration:**

1. **Modify `AndroidManifest.xml`:** Add an intent filter to handle the deep links. This filter specifies the URL scheme and host that your app will respond to.

   ```xml
   <activity
       android:name=".MainActivity"
       android:launchMode="singleTask">
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
           <data
               android:scheme="https"
               android:host="www.example.com"/>
       </intent-filter>
   </activity>
   ```

2. **Enable App Links:** To support App Links, you must verify your domain with Google. This involves hosting a `assetlinks.json` file on your server.

**iOS Configuration:**

1. **Modify `Info.plist`:** Add URL types to handle custom schemes and associated domains for Universal Links.

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
           <string>com.example.myapp</string>
           <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
           <array>
               <string>myapp</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </array>
   <key>NSUserActivityTypes</key>
   <array>
       <string>NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Enable Universal Links:** Set up an `apple-app-site-association` file on your server to associate your app with your domain.

#### Listening for Deep Links

Once your app is configured to handle deep links, you need to listen for incoming links and navigate to the appropriate content.

**Listening for Incoming Links:**

In your Flutter app, use the `uni_links` package to listen for incoming links. Add the following code to your main widget:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uni_links/uni_links.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  StreamSubscription? _sub;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _sub = linkStream.listen((String? link) {
      if (link != null) {
        // Parse the link and navigate accordingly
        _navigateToPage(link);
      }
    }, onError: (err) {
      // Handle error
    });
  }

  void _navigateToPage(String link) {
    // Extract parameters from the link and navigate
    Uri uri = Uri.parse(link);
    if (uri.pathSegments.contains('page')) {
      Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/page');
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _sub?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Deep Linking Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Home Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Handling Initial Links:**

When the app is opened via a deep link, you need to handle the initial link. Use the `getInitialLink` method provided by the `uni_links` package:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _initDeepLink();
}

Future<void> _initDeepLink() async {
  try {
    final initialLink = await getInitialLink();
    if (initialLink != null) {
      _navigateToPage(initialLink);
    }
  } on PlatformException {
    // Handle exception
  }
}
```

### Navigation Based on Links

To navigate based on the link, parse the URL to extract parameters and use Flutter's `Navigator` to direct the user to the appropriate screen.

**Example:**

```dart
void _navigateToPage(String link) {
  Uri uri = Uri.parse(link);
  if (uri.pathSegments.contains('item')) {
    String? itemId = uri.queryParameters['id'];
    if (itemId != null) {
      Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/item', arguments: itemId);
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Deep Links

Testing deep links is crucial to ensure they work as expected on both emulators and real devices.

**Testing on Android:**

Use the `adb` command to simulate a deep link:

```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myapp://item?id=123"
```

**Testing on iOS:**

Use the Safari browser to open a Universal Link or use a custom URL scheme in the simulator.

### Best Practices

When implementing deep linking, consider the following best practices to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience:

- **Validate Incoming URLs:** Always validate and sanitize incoming URLs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as URL spoofing or injection attacks.

- **Handle Invalid Links Gracefully:** Provide feedback to users when a link is invalid or malformed, and guide them to the appropriate content or the app's home screen.

- **Test Across Devices:** Ensure that deep links work consistently across different devices and operating systems.

### Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of deep linking, try the following exercises:

1. **Add Deep Link Support:** Implement deep linking in your Flutter app using the `uni_links` package. Configure both Universal Links and Custom URL Schemes.

2. **Create a Link to a Detail Page:** Create a deep link that navigates to a specific item's detail page in your app. Ensure that the link works on both Android and iOS.

3. **Test Your Implementation:** Use emulators and real devices to test your deep linking implementation. Verify that the app opens correctly and navigates to the intended content.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively implement deep linking in your Flutter app, enhancing user engagement and providing a seamless navigation experience.
