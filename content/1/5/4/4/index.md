## 5.4.4 Navigation in Web and Desktop Apps

As Flutter continues to evolve, its ability to support web and desktop platforms opens up new possibilities for developers. However, this also introduces unique challenges, particularly in terms of navigation. Understanding the differences in navigation paradigms between mobile, web, and desktop applications is crucial for creating seamless user experiences. In this section, we will explore how to implement effective navigation strategies for web and desktop apps using Flutter.

### Differences in Navigation Paradigms

Flutter's cross-platform capabilities mean that developers can use a single codebase to target mobile, web, and desktop platforms. However, each platform has its own navigation paradigms and user expectations. For instance, mobile apps often rely on stack-based navigation, while web apps use URL-based navigation. Desktop applications, on the other hand, might incorporate menu bars and breadcrumbs.

#### Key Differences:

- **Mobile Apps**: Typically use stack-based navigation, where screens are pushed onto or popped off a stack.
- **Web Apps**: Use URL-based navigation, allowing users to navigate directly to specific pages using URLs.
- **Desktop Apps**: Often incorporate traditional navigation elements like menu bars, toolbars, and breadcrumbs.

### Using URL-based Navigation

URL-based navigation is a cornerstone of web applications, allowing users to navigate directly to specific pages using URLs. In Flutter, this can be achieved using packages like `go_router` or `flutter_modular`, which simplify the process of managing routes and URLs.

#### URL-based Navigation for Web Apps

To implement URL-based navigation in Flutter web apps, you can use the `go_router` package. This package provides a simple and declarative API for defining routes and handling navigation.

**Step-by-Step Implementation with `go_router`:**

1. **Add the `go_router` Package:**

   First, add the `go_router` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     go_router: ^3.0.0
   ```

2. **Define Your Routes:**

   Define your application's routes using the `GoRouter` class. Each route is associated with a path and a corresponding widget.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
       routes: <GoRoute>[
         GoRoute(
           path: '/',
           builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
             return HomeScreen();
           },
         ),
         GoRoute(
           path: '/details',
           builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
             return DetailsScreen();
           },
         ),
       ],
     );

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp.router(
         routerDelegate: _router.routerDelegate,
         routeInformationParser: _router.routeInformationParser,
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Navigate Using URLs:**

   Use the `GoRouter` methods to navigate between pages. For example, to navigate to the details page, you can use:

   ```dart
   context.go('/details');
   ```

4. **Handle Back Button Behavior:**

   Ensure that the browser back button works correctly by relying on the `GoRouter` package, which automatically handles the browser history.

#### Using `Router` and `RouteInformationParser`

For more advanced use cases, you can implement URL-based navigation using the `Router` widget and `RouteInformationParser`. This approach provides more control over the routing process.

**Example Implementation:**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp.router(
      routerDelegate: MyRouterDelegate(),
      routeInformationParser: MyRouteInformationParser(),
    );
  }
}

class MyRouterDelegate extends RouterDelegate
    with ChangeNotifier, PopNavigatorRouterDelegateMixin {
  final GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navigatorKey;

  MyRouterDelegate() : navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Navigator(
      key: navigatorKey,
      pages: [
        MaterialPage(child: HomeScreen()),
        // Add more pages here based on the current route
      ],
      onPopPage: (route, result) {
        if (!route.didPop(result)) {
          return false;
        }
        // Handle back navigation
        return true;
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Future<void> setNewRoutePath(configuration) async {
    // Handle new route path
  }
}

class MyRouteInformationParser extends RouteInformationParser {
  @override
  Future parseRouteInformation(RouteInformation routeInformation) async {
    // Parse route information
  }
}
```

### Adapting to Platform Conventions

When developing web and desktop applications, it's important to adapt to platform-specific conventions to ensure a native user experience.

#### Breadcrumb Navigation for Desktop Apps

Breadcrumb navigation is a common pattern in desktop applications, providing users with a trail of links to navigate back to previous pages.

**Implementing Breadcrumbs:**

```dart
class Breadcrumbs extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> paths;

  Breadcrumbs({required this.paths});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      children: paths.map((path) {
        return GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            // Navigate to the selected path
          },
          child: Text(path),
        );
      }).toList(),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Back Button Behavior in Web Apps

Ensuring that the browser back button works correctly is crucial for web applications. Using packages like `go_router`, this behavior is handled automatically, maintaining the browser history and allowing users to navigate back to previous pages.

### Responsive Navigation

Responsive design is essential for creating applications that work seamlessly across different screen sizes. In Flutter, you can adjust navigation patterns based on the screen size to provide an optimal user experience.

#### Adjusting Navigation Patterns

- **Small Screens**: Use bottom navigation bars or tab bars for easy access to key sections.
- **Large Screens**: Implement drawers or sidebars to provide additional navigation options.

**Example of Responsive Navigation:**

```dart
class ResponsiveScaffold extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {
        if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive App')),
            bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
              items: [
                BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
                BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.settings), label: 'Settings'),
              ],
            ),
            body: HomeScreen(),
          );
        } else {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Responsive App')),
            drawer: Drawer(
              child: ListView(
                children: [
                  ListTile(title: Text('Home'), onTap: () {}),
                  ListTile(title: Text('Settings'), onTap: () {}),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            body: HomeScreen(),
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Practice Exercises

To solidify your understanding of navigation in Flutter web and desktop apps, try the following exercises:

#### Exercise 1: Build a Simple Web App with URL-based Navigation

1. **Create a New Flutter Web Project**: Use `flutter create` to set up a new project.
2. **Implement URL-based Navigation**: Use the `go_router` package to define routes and handle navigation.
3. **Test Back Button Behavior**: Ensure that the browser back button works as expected.

#### Exercise 2: Implement Platform-specific Navigation Behaviors

1. **Add Breadcrumb Navigation**: Implement breadcrumbs for a desktop app to allow users to navigate back to previous pages.
2. **Create a Responsive Layout**: Adjust the navigation patterns based on screen size, using drawers or sidebars for larger screens.
