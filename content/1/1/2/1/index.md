## 1.2.1 System Requirements

Embarking on your journey into Flutter app development requires a solid understanding of the system requirements and environment setup. This section will guide you through the necessary hardware and software prerequisites, ensuring your development environment is optimized for building efficient and responsive Flutter applications.

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

To ensure a smooth and efficient development experience with Flutter, your machine should meet the following minimum hardware specifications:

- **RAM:** At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended. While Flutter can run on systems with less memory, having 8 GB or more will significantly enhance performance, particularly when running emulators or multiple applications simultaneously.
- **CPU:** A multi-core processor is essential. A modern Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor (or better) is recommended for handling the demands of development tools and emulators.
- **Storage:** A minimum of 10 GB of free disk space is required to accommodate Flutter SDK, Android Studio, and other necessary tools. An SSD (Solid State Drive) is highly recommended for faster build times and improved overall system responsiveness.

**Enhanced Development Experience:**
- **SSD:** Utilizing an SSD instead of an HDD can drastically reduce build times and improve the speed of file operations, which is crucial when dealing with large projects or frequent builds.

### Supported Operating Systems

Flutter supports development on major operating systems, each with specific version requirements:

- **Windows:** Version 7 SP1 or later (64-bit) is required. However, for optimal performance and access to the latest features, Windows 10 or later is recommended.
- **macOS:** Version 10.12 (Sierra) or later is necessary. macOS is essential for developing iOS applications due to the requirement of Xcode.
- **Linux:** Flutter supports various Linux distributions. It's advisable to refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux) for a comprehensive list of supported distributions and specific requirements.

### Software Prerequisites

Setting up your software environment is crucial for Flutter development. Below are the essential software components you need:

#### Version Control System

- **Git:** Git is a distributed version control system that is essential for managing your codebase. Ensure Git is installed and configured on your system. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

#### Android Development

For Android app development, the following tools are required:

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** JDK 8 or higher is necessary for Android development. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- **Android SDK:** The Android Software Development Kit is essential for building Android applications. It can be installed via Android Studio.
- **Android Studio:** This is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development. It includes the Android SDK and emulator. Download it from [Android Studio's official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

#### iOS Development (macOS Only)

Developing iOS applications requires a macOS environment due to Apple's development ecosystem:

- **Xcode:** Apple's official IDE for iOS development. It can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Xcode includes the iOS SDK and simulator necessary for building and testing iOS apps.

### Environment Variables

Configuring environment variables is a critical step in setting up your Flutter development environment. The `PATH` environment variable must include the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to execute Flutter commands from any terminal session.

#### Setting the `PATH` Environment Variable

Below are step-by-step instructions for setting the `PATH` variable on different operating systems:

##### Windows

1. **Locate the Flutter SDK Path:**
   - After downloading and extracting the Flutter SDK, note the path to the `bin` directory. For example, `C:\flutter\bin`.

2. **Open Environment Variables:**
   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
   - Click on 'Environment Variables'.

3. **Edit the `PATH` Variable:**
   - Under 'System variables', find and select the `Path` variable, then click 'Edit'.
   - Click 'New' and add the path to the Flutter `bin` directory.

4. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt and run `flutter doctor` to verify the installation.

##### macOS

1. **Locate the Flutter SDK Path:**
   - Note the path to the `bin` directory of the extracted Flutter SDK. For example, `/Users/yourname/flutter/bin`.

2. **Edit the `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Use a text editor to open the `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory. For example, `nano ~/.zshrc`.

3. **Add the Flutter Path:**
   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:/Users/yourname/flutter/bin"
     ```

4. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes.

5. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Run `flutter doctor` in Terminal to verify the installation.

##### Linux

1. **Locate the Flutter SDK Path:**
   - Note the path to the `bin` directory of the extracted Flutter SDK. For example, `/home/yourname/flutter/bin`.

2. **Edit the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Use a text editor to open the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in your home directory. For example, `nano ~/.bashrc`.

3. **Add the Flutter Path:**
   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:/home/yourname/flutter/bin"
     ```

4. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

5. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Run `flutter doctor` in Terminal to verify the installation.

### Setup Process Flowchart

To visualize the setup process, refer to the following flowchart, which outlines the steps required to configure your Flutter development environment:
