## 1.4.3 Control Flow Statements

In the journey of Flutter app development, understanding control flow statements is crucial. These statements allow you to dictate the execution path of your code, making it dynamic and responsive to different conditions. This section will guide you through the various control flow statements available in Dart, the language used for Flutter development. We will cover conditional statements, loops, and control flow keywords, providing practical examples and insights into best practices.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are the backbone of decision-making in programming. They allow your application to execute certain parts of code based on specific conditions.

#### `if`, `else if`, `else`

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, you can use `else if` to test another condition or `else` to execute a block of code when none of the previous conditions are met.

**Syntax:**

```dart
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
  // Code to execute if anotherCondition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  int temperature = 30;

  if (temperature > 30) {
    print('It\'s a hot day!');
  } else if (temperature > 20) {
    print('It\'s a warm day.');
  } else {
    print('It\'s a cold day.');
  }
}
```

In this example, the program checks the temperature and prints a message based on its value. Try changing the `temperature` variable and predict the output before running the code.

#### Switch Statements

The `switch` statement is an alternative to using multiple `if` statements. It evaluates an expression and executes the matching `case` block. The `break` statement is crucial here to prevent fall-through, and the `default` case handles any unmatched conditions.

**Syntax:**

```dart
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression == value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression == value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to execute if no case matches
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  String grade = 'B';

  switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
      print('Excellent!');
      break;
    case 'B':
      print('Good job!');
      break;
    case 'C':
      print('You can do better.');
      break;
    default:
      print('Invalid grade.');
  }
}
```

This example evaluates the `grade` variable and prints a message based on its value. Experiment with different grades to see how the output changes.

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Dart provides several types of loops, each suited for different scenarios.

#### For Loops

The `for` loop is ideal for iterating a specific number of times. It's commonly used for iterating over collections.

**Standard `for` Loop Syntax:**

```dart
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print('Iteration $i');
  }
}
```

This loop prints "Iteration" followed by the current iteration number five times.

**Iterating Over Collections:**

```dart
void main() {
  List<String> fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

  for (int i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    print(fruits[i]);
  }
}
```

Here, the loop iterates over a list of fruits and prints each one.

#### While Loops

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The `do-while` loop is similar but guarantees at least one execution of the block.

**Syntax for `while` Loop:**

```dart
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

**Syntax for `do-while` Loop:**

```dart
do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  int count = 0;

  while (count < 3) {
    print('Count is $count');
    count++;
  }
}
```

This `while` loop prints the count until it reaches 3.

**Difference Between `while` and `do-while`:**

The `do-while` loop executes its block at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

```dart
void main() {
  int count = 5;

  do {
    print('Count is $count');
    count++;
  } while (count < 3);
}
```

In this example, the message is printed once, despite the condition being false.

#### ForEach Loops

The `forEach` method is a convenient way to iterate over collections, especially when you don't need an index.

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  List<String> animals = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Elephant'];

  animals.forEach((animal) {
    print(animal);
  });
}
```

This loop prints each animal in the list. It's concise and eliminates the need for manual index management.

### Control Flow Keywords

Control flow keywords like `break` and `continue` modify the execution of loops.

#### `break`

The `break` statement exits the loop immediately.

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
      break;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}
```

This loop stops when `i` equals 3, printing 0, 1, and 2.

#### `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
      continue;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}
```

This loop skips printing 2, but prints 0, 1, 3, and 4.

### Practical Examples

Let's put these concepts into practice with a simple problem: finding the sum of even numbers in a list.

**Example:**

```dart
void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  int sum = 0;

  for (int number in numbers) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
      sum += number;
    }
  }

  print('Sum of even numbers: $sum');
}
```

In this example, the loop iterates over the list, checks if each number is even, and adds it to the `sum`. Predict the output before running the code.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Use `switch` for Multiple Conditions:** When you have multiple conditions based on a single variable, prefer `switch` over multiple `if` statements for better readability.
- **Avoid Infinite Loops:** Ensure loop conditions eventually become false to prevent infinite loops.
- **Use `forEach` for Readability:** When iterating over collections without needing an index, use `forEach` for cleaner code.
- **Predict and Test Outputs:** Always predict the output of your control flow logic and test it to ensure correctness.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Unexpected Loop Behavior:** If a loop doesn't behave as expected, check the condition and the logic inside the loop.
- **Switch Case Fall-Through:** Ensure `break` statements are used in `switch` cases to prevent unintended fall-through.
- **Off-by-One Errors:** Double-check loop boundaries to avoid off-by-one errors, especially in `for` loops.

By mastering control flow statements, you'll be able to write more dynamic and efficient Flutter applications. Practice these concepts with different scenarios to solidify your understanding.

> **Explanation:** The `break` statement is used to exit a loop immediately.

### How does a `do-while` loop differ from a `while` loop?

- [x] A `do-while` loop executes its block at least once
- [ ] A `do-while` loop executes only if the condition is true
- [ ] A `do-while` loop cannot contain a `break` statement
- [ ] A `do-while` loop is the same as a `while` loop

> **Explanation:** A `do-while` loop executes its block at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

### What is the role of the `default` case in a `switch` statement?

- [x] To handle any unmatched conditions

> **Explanation:** The `default` case is used to handle any conditions that do not match any of the specified cases.

### Which loop is best suited for iterating over a collection without needing an index?

- [ ] for loop
- [x] forEach loop
- [ ] while loop
- [ ] do-while loop

> **Explanation:** The `forEach` loop is best suited for iterating over a collection without needing an index.

### What does the `continue` statement do in a loop?

- [x] Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one
- [ ] Exits the loop immediately
- [ ] Restarts the loop
- [ ] Ends the program

> **Explanation:** The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
