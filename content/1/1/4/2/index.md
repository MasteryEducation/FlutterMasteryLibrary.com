## 1.4.2 Operators and Expressions

In the realm of programming, operators and expressions form the backbone of logic and computation. As you embark on your Flutter journey, understanding these fundamental concepts in Dart, the language that powers Flutter, is crucial. This section will guide you through the various types of operators available in Dart, how they are used in expressions, and how they can be leveraged to build robust Flutter applications.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are the most basic operators used in programming. They perform mathematical operations on numeric values. Dart supports the following arithmetic operators:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second, resulting in a double.
- **Integer Division (`~/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second, resulting in an integer.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

#### Example Code

```dart
void main() {
  int a = 10;
  int b = 3;

  print('Addition: ${a + b}'); // Output: 13
  print('Subtraction: ${a - b}'); // Output: 7
  print('Multiplication: ${a * b}'); // Output: 30
  print('Division: ${a / b}'); // Output: 3.3333333333333335
  print('Integer Division: ${a ~/ b}'); // Output: 3
  print('Modulus: ${a % b}'); // Output: 1
}
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Dart provides several assignment operators that not only assign but also perform operations:

- **Simple Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the right operand to the left operand.
- **Add and Assign (`+=`)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Subtract and Assign (`-=`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Multiply and Assign (`*=`)**: Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Divide and Assign (`/=`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

#### Example Code

```dart
void main() {
  int a = 5;
  a += 2; // Equivalent to a = a + 2
  print('After += : $a'); // Output: 7

  a -= 2; // Equivalent to a = a - 2
  print('After -= : $a'); // Output: 5

  a *= 2; // Equivalent to a = a * 2
  print('After *= : $a'); // Output: 10

  a /= 2; // Equivalent to a = a / 2
  print('After /= : $a'); // Output: 5.0
}
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison:

- **Equality (`==`)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
- **Inequality (`!=`)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

#### Example Code

```dart
void main() {
  int x = 10;
  int y = 20;

  print('x == y: ${x == y}'); // Output: false
  print('x != y: ${x != y}'); // Output: true
  print('x > y: ${x > y}'); // Output: false
  print('x < y: ${x < y}'); // Output: true
  print('x >= y: ${x >= y}'); // Output: false
  print('x <= y: ${x <= y}'); // Output: true
}
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or values. Dart supports the following logical operators:

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one of the operands is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the boolean value of the operand.

#### Example Code

```dart
void main() {
  bool isFlutterFun = true;
  bool isDartEasy = true;

  print('isFlutterFun && isDartEasy: ${isFlutterFun && isDartEasy}'); // Output: true
  print('isFlutterFun || isDartEasy: ${isFlutterFun || isDartEasy}'); // Output: true
  print('!isFlutterFun: ${!isFlutterFun}'); // Output: false
}
```

### Conditional Expressions

Conditional expressions allow you to write concise code for making decisions. Dart provides a ternary operator and null-aware operators for this purpose.

#### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for `if-else` statements. It takes the form `condition ? expr1 : expr2`.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 18;
  String eligibility = age >= 18 ? 'Eligible to vote' : 'Not eligible to vote';
  print(eligibility); // Output: Eligible to vote
}
```

#### Null-Aware Operators

Null-aware operators are useful for handling null values gracefully:

- **`??`**: Provides a default value if the operand is null.
- **`?.`**: Safely accesses a member of an object that might be null.
- **`??=`**: Assigns a value to a variable only if it is currently null.

```dart
void main() {
  String? name;
  print(name ?? 'Guest'); // Output: Guest

  int? length = name?.length;
  print(length); // Output: null

  name ??= 'John Doe';
  print(name); // Output: John Doe
}
```

### Expressions

Expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that yield a result. In Dart, expressions can be as simple as a single variable or as complex as a combination of multiple operators and operands.

#### Example Code

```dart
void main() {
  int a = 5;
  int b = 10;
  int c = 15;

  int result = a + b * c - (b ~/ a);
  print('Result: $result'); // Output: 148
}
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Operator Precedence**: Be mindful of operator precedence to avoid unexpected results. Use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations.
- **Null Safety**: Utilize null-aware operators to prevent null reference errors.
- **Readability**: Write expressions that are easy to read and understand. Avoid overly complex expressions that can be broken down into simpler parts.

### Hands-On Activity

Try creating a simple Dart program that calculates the area of a rectangle and a circle using arithmetic operators. Use conditional expressions to check if the calculated area exceeds a certain threshold and print a message accordingly.

```dart
void main() {
  double length = 10.0;
  double width = 5.0;
  double radius = 3.0;

  double rectangleArea = length * width;
  double circleArea = 3.14159 * radius * radius;

  print('Rectangle Area: $rectangleArea');
  print('Circle Area: $circleArea');

  String rectangleMessage = rectangleArea > 50 ? 'Large Rectangle' : 'Small Rectangle';
  String circleMessage = circleArea > 30 ? 'Large Circle' : 'Small Circle';

  print(rectangleMessage);
  print(circleMessage);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Syntax Errors**: Ensure that all operators are used correctly and that parentheses are balanced.
- **Null Reference Errors**: Use null-aware operators when dealing with nullable types.
- **Logical Errors**: Double-check the logic of your expressions to ensure they produce the desired results.

## Quiz Time!

### Which operator is used for integer division in Dart?

- [ ] /
- [x] ~/
- [ ] %
- [ ] //

> **Explanation:** The `~/` operator is used for integer division in Dart, which returns the quotient as an integer.

### What does the `+=` operator do?

- [x] Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- [ ] Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- [ ] Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- [ ] Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

> **Explanation:** The `+=` operator is a shorthand for adding the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result back to the left operand.

### What is the output of `print(10 > 5 && 5 < 3);`?

- [ ] true
- [x] false
- [ ] 10
- [ ] 5

> **Explanation:** The expression `10 > 5` is true, but `5 < 3` is false. Since both conditions must be true for the `&&` operator to return true, the result is false.

### How do you safely access a property of an object that might be null?

- [ ] Using `??`
- [ ] Using `??=`
- [x] Using `?.`
- [ ] Using `&&`

> **Explanation:** The `?.` operator is used to safely access a property of an object that might be null, preventing null reference errors.

### Which operator provides a default value if the operand is null?

- [x] ??
- [ ] ?.
- [ ] ??=
- [ ] &&

> **Explanation:** The `??` operator provides a default value if the operand on its left is null.

### What is the result of `print(5 % 2);`?

- [x] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 5

> **Explanation:** The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of 5 by 2, which is 1.

### What does the expression `x ??= 10;` do?

- [x] Assigns 10 to `x` only if `x` is null.
- [ ] Always assigns 10 to `x`.
- [ ] Assigns `x` to 10 if `x` is not null.
- [ ] Adds 10 to `x`.

> **Explanation:** The `??=` operator assigns a value to a variable only if it is currently null.

### Which of the following is a conditional expression?

- [x] `condition ? expr1 : expr2`
- [ ] `expr1 && expr2`
- [ ] `expr1 || expr2`
- [ ] `expr1 + expr2`

> **Explanation:** The ternary operator `condition ? expr1 : expr2` is a conditional expression that evaluates to `expr1` if the condition is true, and `expr2` otherwise.

### What is the output of `print(!(true || false));`?

- [x] false
- [ ] true
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1

> **Explanation:** The expression `true || false` evaluates to true, and the `!` operator negates it, resulting in false.

### True or False: The `==` operator can be used to compare both primitive types and objects in Dart.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** In Dart, the `==` operator can be used to compare both primitive types and objects. For objects, it checks for equality based on the `==` method implementation.
