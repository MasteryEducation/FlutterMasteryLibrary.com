## 7.3.1 SharedPreferences for Key-Value Storage

In the realm of mobile app development, managing data persistence efficiently is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications, offers several options for data storage. Among these, `SharedPreferences` stands out as a simple yet effective solution for storing key-value pairs persistently. This section delves into the intricacies of using `SharedPreferences` in Flutter, providing a comprehensive guide for beginners and seasoned developers alike.

### Introduction to SharedPreferences

`SharedPreferences` is a lightweight storage solution that allows you to store simple key-value pairs persistently on the device. It is particularly suitable for storing user preferences, settings, or small amounts of data that need to be retained across app sessions. Unlike databases, which are designed for complex data structures and large datasets, `SharedPreferences` is optimized for simplicity and speed, making it ideal for quick data retrieval and storage.

#### Key Features of SharedPreferences

- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use, requiring minimal setup.
- **Persistence**: Data stored in `SharedPreferences` persists across app restarts.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for storing small amounts of data quickly.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a variety of data types, including `int`, `double`, `bool`, `String`, and `List<String>`.

### Adding SharedPreferences Package

To utilize `SharedPreferences` in your Flutter project, you need to add the `shared_preferences` package to your project dependencies. This package provides the necessary APIs to store and retrieve data.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**: Add the `shared_preferences` package to your project's dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     shared_preferences: ^2.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

By following these steps, you have successfully integrated the `SharedPreferences` package into your Flutter project, enabling you to start storing and retrieving data.

### Storing Data

Once the package is added, you can begin storing data using `SharedPreferences`. The following example demonstrates how to store an integer value, such as a counter, persistently.

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<void> saveCounter(int counter) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setInt('counter', counter);
}
```

#### Explanation

- **`SharedPreferences.getInstance()`**: This method retrieves the singleton instance of `SharedPreferences`.
- **`setInt('counter', counter)`**: Stores the integer value associated with the key `'counter'`.

### Retrieving Data

Retrieving data from `SharedPreferences` is just as straightforward as storing it. The following example shows how to read the stored counter value.

```dart
Future<int> getCounter() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  return prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- **`getInt('counter')`**: Retrieves the integer value associated with the key `'counter'`. If the key does not exist, it returns `0` as a default value.

### Supported Data Types

`SharedPreferences` supports a variety of data types, making it versatile for different storage needs. The supported types include:

- **`int`**: For storing integer values.
- **`double`**: For storing floating-point numbers.
- **`bool`**: For storing boolean values.
- **`String`**: For storing text data.
- **`List<String>`**: For storing lists of strings.

### Handling Asynchronous Calls

Working with `SharedPreferences` involves asynchronous operations, as data retrieval and storage are performed in the background. It is crucial to handle these operations correctly to ensure smooth app performance.

#### Best Practices

- **Use `await`**: Always use the `await` keyword when calling asynchronous methods to ensure that the operation completes before proceeding.
- **Handle Futures**: If not using `await`, handle futures appropriately using `.then()` or other future-handling mechanisms.

### Example Application

To illustrate the use of `SharedPreferences`, let's create a simple Flutter application where a counter value persists between app restarts. This example will demonstrate the complete workflow of storing and retrieving data using `SharedPreferences`.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create a New Flutter Project**: Use the following command to create a new Flutter project.

   ```bash
   flutter create counter_app
   ```

2. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**: Add the `shared_preferences` package as described earlier.

3. **Implement the Counter Logic**: Modify the `main.dart` file to include the counter logic.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: CounterPage(),
       );
     }
   }

   class CounterPage extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _CounterPageState createState() => _CounterPageState();
   }

   class _CounterPageState extends State<CounterPage> {
     int _counter = 0;

     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       _loadCounter();
     }

     // Load counter value from SharedPreferences
     Future<void> _loadCounter() async {
       final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
       setState(() {
         _counter = prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0;
       });
     }

     // Increment counter and save to SharedPreferences
     Future<void> _incrementCounter() async {
       setState(() {
         _counter++;
       });
       final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
       await prefs.setInt('counter', _counter);
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Persistent Counter'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: <Widget>[
               Text(
                 'You have pushed the button this many times:',
               ),
               Text(
                 '$_counter',
                 style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
         floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
           onPressed: _incrementCounter,
           tooltip: 'Increment',
           child: Icon(Icons.add),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: Use the following command to run the application.

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

With this implementation, the counter value will persist across app restarts, demonstrating the practical use of `SharedPreferences` for data persistence.

### Limitations

While `SharedPreferences` is a powerful tool for storing key-value pairs, it has certain limitations that developers should be aware of:

- **Not Suitable for Large Data**: `SharedPreferences` is not designed for storing large amounts of data. For complex data structures or large datasets, consider using a database solution like SQLite or Hive.
- **Plain Text Storage**: Data in `SharedPreferences` is stored as plain text, making it unsuitable for sensitive information. Avoid storing passwords or personal data without encryption.

### Best Practices

To make the most of `SharedPreferences`, consider the following best practices:

- **Use Descriptive Keys**: Choose clear and descriptive keys to avoid conflicts and improve code readability.
- **Consistent Data Storage**: Keep your data storage organized and consistent. Group related data under common prefixes or categories.
- **Avoid Blocking the UI**: Perform `SharedPreferences` operations in the background to prevent blocking the UI thread.

### Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of `SharedPreferences`, try implementing the following exercises:

1. **User Preferences**: Implement a feature that allows users to select a theme (light or dark) and persist their choice using `SharedPreferences`.

2. **Data Migration**: Handle data migration if the structure of stored data changes. For example, if you initially stored a single value and later need to store a list, implement a migration strategy to update existing data.

### Conclusion

`SharedPreferences` is an invaluable tool for Flutter developers, providing a simple and efficient way to store key-value pairs persistently. By understanding its capabilities, limitations, and best practices, you can effectively manage data persistence in your Flutter applications, enhancing the user experience and maintaining data integrity.
