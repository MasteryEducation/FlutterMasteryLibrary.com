## 7.4.2 Detecting Network Connectivity

In the modern world of mobile applications, ensuring seamless network connectivity is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. Whether your app fetches data from a remote server, uploads user-generated content, or simply needs to check for updates, understanding and managing network connectivity is essential. In this section, we will explore how to detect network connectivity in Flutter using the `connectivity_plus` package, a powerful tool that allows developers to monitor and respond to changes in network status effectively.

### Introduction to Network Connectivity in Flutter

Network connectivity in mobile applications refers to the ability of the app to connect to the internet via various means such as Wi-Fi, mobile data, or other network types. Detecting and responding to changes in network connectivity can significantly enhance the user experience by allowing the app to handle offline scenarios gracefully, queue requests for later execution, and provide feedback to users when connectivity is lost or restored.

### Setting Up the Connectivity Plus Package

To begin detecting network connectivity in your Flutter application, you need to integrate the `connectivity_plus` package. This package provides a simple API to check the current network status and listen for connectivity changes.

#### Adding the Package to Your Project

First, add the `connectivity_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  connectivity_plus: ^2.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command fetches the package and makes it available in your Flutter project.

### Checking Current Connectivity Status

Once the package is installed, you can use it to check the current network connectivity status. This is useful for determining whether the device is connected to a network and, if so, what type of network it is connected to (e.g., Wi-Fi or mobile data).

Here's a simple example of how to check the current connectivity status:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity_plus/connectivity_plus.dart';

Future<void> checkConnectivity() async {
  var connectivityResult = await (Connectivity().checkConnectivity());
  if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.mobile) {
    print('Connected to a mobile network');
  } else if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.wifi) {
    print('Connected to a Wi-Fi network');
  } else {
    print('No network connection');
  }
}
```

In this example, the `checkConnectivity` function uses the `Connectivity` class to determine the current network status. The result is compared against predefined constants (`ConnectivityResult.mobile`, `ConnectivityResult.wifi`, and `ConnectivityResult.none`) to identify the type of connection or lack thereof.

### Listening for Connectivity Changes

In addition to checking the current connectivity status, it's often necessary to respond to changes in network connectivity. For example, you might want to notify users when they go offline or automatically retry failed network requests when the connection is restored.

The `connectivity_plus` package provides a convenient way to listen for connectivity changes using a stream:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity_plus/connectivity_plus.dart';

void listenForConnectivityChanges() {
  Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((ConnectivityResult result) {
    switch (result) {
      case ConnectivityResult.mobile:
        print('Switched to mobile network');
        break;
      case ConnectivityResult.wifi:
        print('Switched to Wi-Fi network');
        break;
      case ConnectivityResult.none:
        print('Lost network connection');
        break;
      default:
        print('Unknown network status');
    }
  });
}
```

In this example, the `onConnectivityChanged` stream emits events whenever the network connectivity changes. By listening to this stream, you can update the app's UI or behavior in response to connectivity changes.

### Handling Network Changes

Handling network changes effectively involves more than just detecting them. It's important to provide feedback to users and adjust the app's behavior to ensure a seamless experience. Here are some strategies for handling network changes:

#### Providing User Feedback

When network connectivity is lost or restored, it's a good practice to inform users about the current status. This can be done using visual indicators such as banners, snack bars, or dialogs.

```dart
void showConnectivityStatus(BuildContext context, ConnectivityResult result) {
  String message;
  if (result == ConnectivityResult.none) {
    message = 'You are offline. Some features may not be available.';
  } else {
    message = 'You are back online!';
  }

  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text(message),
      duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
    ),
  );
}
```

This function displays a snack bar with a message indicating the current connectivity status. You can call this function whenever the connectivity changes to keep users informed.

#### Adjusting App Behavior

When the network connection is lost, certain app features may become unavailable. In such cases, it's important to handle these scenarios gracefully. For example, you might queue network requests to be retried when the connection is restored.

```dart
void handleNetworkRequest() async {
  var connectivityResult = await Connectivity().checkConnectivity();
  if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.none) {
    // Queue the request for later
    print('Network request queued due to no connectivity');
  } else {
    // Proceed with the network request
    print('Executing network request');
  }
}
```

In this example, the app checks for connectivity before making a network request. If there is no connection, the request is queued for later execution.

### Best Practices for Network Connectivity

When dealing with network connectivity in Flutter, there are several best practices to keep in mind:

- **Do Not Assume Connectivity Means Internet Access:** Even if a device is connected to a network, it doesn't guarantee internet access. There could be issues such as a captive portal that requires user authentication.

- **Implement Retries:** When connectivity is restored, consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed network requests. This ensures that important actions are not lost due to temporary connectivity issues.

- **Optimize for Offline Use:** Where possible, design your app to function offline. This might involve caching data locally or providing limited functionality when offline.

- **Test on Real Devices:** Network conditions can vary significantly between emulators and real devices. Always test your app's connectivity features on physical devices to ensure they work as expected.

### Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of network connectivity in Flutter, try the following exercises:

1. **Add Network Connectivity Checks to Your App:**
   - Implement a feature that checks the current connectivity status when the app starts and displays the result to the user.

2. **Display a Message When the Device is Offline:**
   - Use a snack bar or dialog to inform users when they lose network connectivity. Ensure the message is removed when connectivity is restored.

3. **Queue Network Requests:**
   - Modify your app to queue network requests when offline and automatically retry them when the connection is restored.

4. **Implement a Retry Mechanism:**
   - Create a simple retry mechanism for network requests that fail due to connectivity issues. Allow users to manually trigger retries if needed.

By completing these exercises, you'll gain practical experience in managing network connectivity in Flutter applications, enhancing your skills as a mobile developer.

### Conclusion

Detecting and managing network connectivity is a vital aspect of modern mobile app development. By leveraging the `connectivity_plus` package, you can easily monitor network status, respond to changes, and provide a seamless user experience. Remember to follow best practices, such as not assuming connectivity means internet access and implementing retries for failed requests. With these skills, you'll be well-equipped to build robust and user-friendly Flutter applications.
