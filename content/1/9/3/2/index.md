## 9.3.2 Apple App Store Submission

Submitting your Flutter app to the Apple App Store is a crucial step in bringing your creation to a global audience. This process, while detailed, is manageable with careful preparation and adherence to Apple's guidelines. This section will guide you through each step, ensuring your app is ready for submission and approval.

### Enrolling in the Apple Developer Program

Before you can submit your app, you must enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/). This program provides access to the tools and resources needed to develop and distribute apps on the App Store.

- **Annual Fee:** The program requires an annual fee of $99.
- **Enrollment Options:** Both individuals and organizations can enroll. If enrolling as an organization, you will need a D-U-N-S number, which is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses.

### Preparing Your App for Submission

#### App Icon and Launch Screen

Your app's icon and launch screen are the first impressions users will have, so they must comply with Apple's design guidelines. Ensure your app icon is clear, distinctive, and adheres to the required dimensions and formats.

- **App Icon Guidelines:** Use a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels for the app icon.
- **Launch Screen:** Should be simple and not include text or branding that might change.

#### App Versioning and Build Number

Each submission to the App Store requires a unique build number. Increment the build number with each new submission to track updates and changes effectively.

### Creating an App Store Connect Record

App Store Connect is Apple's platform for managing your apps, where you will create a record for your app.

#### Log in to App Store Connect

Use your Apple ID associated with the Developer Program to log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).

#### Add New App

1. Navigate to **My Apps**.

#### App Information

Provide the necessary details for your app:

- **Platform:** Select iOS.
- **App Name:** Choose a name up to 30 characters.
- **Default Language:** Set the primary language for your app.

### Uploading the Build
