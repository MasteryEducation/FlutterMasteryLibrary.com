## 1.2.1 Installing Flutter and Dart SDK

Setting up your development environment is the first step towards building responsive and adaptive applications with Flutter. This section provides a comprehensive guide on installing the Flutter and Dart SDK, configuring your system, and troubleshooting common issues. By the end of this guide, you'll be ready to start developing Flutter applications.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:**
  - **Windows:** Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
  - **macOS:** macOS 10.14 or later
  - **Linux:** Any recent distribution with a 64-bit architecture

- **Disk Space:** At least 1.64 GB of free disk space (excluding space for IDE/tools).

- **Tools:**
  - **Git:** Flutter SDK is stored in a Git repository, so Git is required to clone the repository.
  - **Command Line Tools:** Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).

- **Additional Requirements for Specific Platforms:**
  - **Windows:** PowerShell 5.0 or newer (pre-installed with Windows 10).
  - **macOS:** Xcode for iOS development.
  - **Linux:** `libGLU` package (install via your package manager).

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Download the Flutter SDK

1. **Visit the Flutter Website:**
   - Navigate to the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and select your operating system.

2. **Download the SDK:**
   - Click on the download link for the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK.

3. **Extract the Files:**
   - **Windows:** Extract the downloaded zip file to a suitable location, such as `C:\src\flutter`.
   - **macOS/Linux:** Use the terminal to extract the tar file:
     ```bash
     tar xf flutter_linux_<version>-stable.tar.xz
     ```

#### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

To use Flutter commands globally, you need to add Flutter to your system's PATH.

- **Windows:**
  1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
  2. Click on "Environment Variables" in the System Properties window.
  3. Under "System variables", find the PATH variable and click "Edit".
  4. Add the path to the Flutter bin directory (e.g., `C:\src\flutter\bin`).

- **macOS/Linux:**
  1. Open your terminal.
  2. Open the bash profile or zsh profile file:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc for zsh users
     ```
  3. Add the following line at the end of the file:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
     ```
  4. Save the file and refresh the terminal:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
     ```

#### Step 3: Verify the Installation

1. **Run Flutter Doctor:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     flutter doctor
     ```
   - This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

2. **Resolve Any Issues:**
   - Follow the instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to resolve any issues. This may include installing additional software or accepting licenses.

```

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter during installation and their solutions:

- **Issue:** `flutter` command not found.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the Flutter bin directory is correctly added to your PATH environment variable.

- **Issue:** `flutter doctor` reports missing dependencies.
  - **Solution:** Follow the instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to install missing dependencies. For example, on macOS, you might need to install Xcode or accept its license agreement.

- **Issue:** Git not installed.
  - **Solution:** Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and ensure it is added to your PATH.

### Code Examples

Here are some terminal commands used during the installation process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable

export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

flutter doctor
```

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep Flutter Updated:** Regularly update your Flutter SDK to benefit from the latest features and fixes. Use the command `flutter upgrade` to update your installation.
  
- **Use Stable Channel:** For production apps, use the stable channel to ensure maximum stability. Switch channels using `flutter channel stable`.

- **Check Compatibility:** Before upgrading, ensure that your dependencies are compatible with the new Flutter version.

### Additional Resources

- [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Flutter GitHub Repository](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
