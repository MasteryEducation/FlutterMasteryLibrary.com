## 3.1.4 Building Custom Widgets

In Flutter, widgets are the building blocks of your application's user interface. While Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built widgets, there are times when you'll need to create custom widgets to meet specific design requirements or to encapsulate complex UI logic. Building custom widgets not only enhances code reusability and maintainability but also allows for greater abstraction and modularity in your app's architecture.

### Why Build Custom Widgets

Creating custom widgets offers several benefits:

- **Code Reusability:** Custom widgets can be reused across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication and simplifying maintenance.
- **Maintainability:** By encapsulating UI logic within custom widgets, you make your codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Abstraction:** Custom widgets allow you to abstract complex UI components into simpler, more manageable pieces, making your code more readable and organized.

When planning your app's architecture, think in terms of widgets. Consider how you can break down your UI into smaller, reusable components that can be easily managed and updated.

### Creating a Custom Stateless Widget

Stateless widgets are immutable and do not hold any state. They are ideal for UI components that do not change over time or in response to user interactions.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Stateless Widget

Let's create a custom stateless widget called `MyCustomButton`. This widget will accept parameters such as `text`, `onPressed`, and `color`.

1. **Define the Widget Class:**

   Start by defining a class that extends `StatelessWidget`.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class MyCustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
     final String text;
     final VoidCallback onPressed;
     final Color color;

     MyCustomButton({
       required this.text,
       required this.onPressed,
       this.color = Colors.blue,
     });

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return ElevatedButton(
         onPressed: onPressed,
         style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(primary: color),
         child: Text(text),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `MyCustomButton` class extends `StatelessWidget`.
   - It takes three parameters: `text`, `onPressed`, and `color`.
   - The `build` method returns an `ElevatedButton` with the specified properties.

2. **Use the Custom Widget in Your App:**

   You can now use `MyCustomButton` in your app like any other widget.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'my_custom_button.dart'; // Import the custom widget

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Button Example')),
           body: Center(
             child: MyCustomButton(
               text: 'Click Me',
               onPressed: () {
                 print('Button Pressed!');
               },
               color: Colors.green,
             ),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `MyCustomButton` is used within the `MyApp` widget.
   - It demonstrates how to pass parameters to the custom widget.

### Creating a Custom Stateful Widget

Stateful widgets are mutable and can hold state that may change over time or in response to user interactions.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Stateful Widget

Let's create a custom stateful widget called `MyToggleSwitch`. This widget will maintain its own state to toggle between on and off.

1. **Define the Stateful Widget Class:**

   Start by defining a class that extends `StatefulWidget`.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class MyToggleSwitch extends StatefulWidget {
     final ValueChanged<bool> onChanged;

     MyToggleSwitch({required this.onChanged});

     @override
     _MyToggleSwitchState createState() => _MyToggleSwitchState();
   }

   class _MyToggleSwitchState extends State<MyToggleSwitch> {
     bool _isOn = false;

     void _toggleSwitch() {
       setState(() {
         _isOn = !_isOn;
       });
       widget.onChanged(_isOn);
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Switch(
         value: _isOn,
         onChanged: (value) {
           _toggleSwitch();
         },
       );
     }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `MyToggleSwitch` class extends `StatefulWidget`.
   - It takes a parameter `onChanged` to notify the parent widget of state changes.
   - The `_MyToggleSwitchState` class manages the internal state `_isOn`.

2. **Use the Custom Stateful Widget in Your App:**

   You can now use `MyToggleSwitch` in your app and respond to its state changes.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'my_toggle_switch.dart'; // Import the custom widget

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Toggle Switch Example')),
           body: Center(
             child: MyToggleSwitch(
               onChanged: (isOn) {
                 print('Switch is now: $isOn');
               },
             ),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `MyToggleSwitch` is used within the `MyApp` widget.
   - It demonstrates how to handle state changes using the `onChanged` callback.

### Composition and Inheritance

#### Composition

Composition involves building complex widgets by combining simpler ones. This approach promotes code reuse and modularity.

- **Example:**

  You can create a custom card widget by composing existing widgets like `Container`, `Text`, and `Image`.

  ```dart
  class MyCustomCard extends StatelessWidget {
    final String title;
    final String subtitle;
    final String imageUrl;

    MyCustomCard({
      required this.title,
      required this.subtitle,
      required this.imageUrl,
    });

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Card(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Image.network(imageUrl),
            ListTile(
              title: Text(title),
              subtitle: Text(subtitle),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  **Explanation:**
  - The `MyCustomCard` widget is composed of an `Image` and a `ListTile`.
  - This demonstrates how to build a complex widget by combining simpler ones.

#### Inheritance

Inheritance can be used to extend existing widgets, but it should be used sparingly. Prefer composition over inheritance for better flexibility and maintainability.

- **Example:**

  You might extend a `Text` widget to add custom styling.

  ```dart
  class MyStyledText extends Text {
    MyStyledText(String data)
        : super(
            data,
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          );
  }
  ```

  **Explanation:**
  - The `MyStyledText` widget extends `Text` to apply custom styling.
  - Use inheritance when you need to slightly modify the behavior of an existing widget.

### Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility:** Keep widgets focused on a single purpose to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Data and Callbacks:** Pass data and callbacks through constructors to maintain a clear flow of information.
- **Avoid Excessive Nesting:** Break down complex UIs into smaller widgets to avoid deeply nested widget trees.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive names for custom widgets to convey their purpose and functionality.

### Visual Aids

#### Widget Tree Diagram

To illustrate how custom widgets fit into the widget tree, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[MyApp] --> B[Scaffold]
    B --> C[AppBar]
    B --> D[Body]
    D --> E[MyCustomButton]
    D --> F[MyToggleSwitch]
```

**Explanation:**
- The diagram shows how `MyCustomButton` and `MyToggleSwitch` are integrated into the widget tree under the `Scaffold`.

#### Refactoring Example

Before refactoring:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: Text('Button 1'),
    ),
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: Text('Button 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

After refactoring into custom widgets:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    MyCustomButton(
      text: 'Button 1',
      onPressed: () {},
    ),
    MyCustomButton(
      text: 'Button 2',
      onPressed: () {},
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Explanation:**
- The refactored code uses `MyCustomButton` to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

### Exercise

**Challenge:** Refactor the following widget tree into smaller custom widgets.

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('Title', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
    ),
    Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('Subtitle', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
    ),
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: Text('Action'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Task:**
- Identify logical components to extract into custom widgets.
- Create a `TitleText` widget and a `SubtitleText` widget.
- Use these custom widgets in the refactored code.

**Solution:**

```dart
class TitleText extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;

  TitleText({required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text(text, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
    );
  }
}

class SubtitleText extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;

  SubtitleText({required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text(text, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
    );
  }
}

// Refactored widget tree
Column(
  children: [
    TitleText(text: 'Title'),
    SubtitleText(text: 'Subtitle'),
    MyCustomButton(
      text: 'Action',
      onPressed: () {},
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Explanation:**
- The `TitleText` and `SubtitleText` widgets encapsulate the styling logic, making the code cleaner and more modular.

### Conclusion

Building custom widgets in Flutter is a powerful way to enhance your app's architecture by promoting code reusability, maintainability, and abstraction. By following best practices and leveraging composition, you can create modular and scalable UIs that are easy to manage and extend. As you continue to develop with Flutter, consider how custom widgets can simplify your codebase and improve the overall quality of your applications.
