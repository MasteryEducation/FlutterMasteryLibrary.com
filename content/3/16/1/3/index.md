## 16.1.3 Implementing Functionality

In this section, we will delve into the implementation of core functionalities for a Flutter To-Do app. This involves managing state, performing CRUD operations, ensuring data persistence, and handling user interactions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build a functional To-Do app with Flutter, equipped with best practices and scalable architecture.

### State Management

#### Choosing a State Management Solution

State management is a crucial aspect of any Flutter application. For a simple To-Do app, using Flutter's built-in `setState` method might be sufficient. However, as the app grows, you might want to consider more scalable solutions like `Provider`, `Riverpod`, or `Bloc`.

- **Using `setState`:** Ideal for small applications where state changes are minimal and localized. It is straightforward but can become cumbersome as the app complexity increases.
  
- **Using `Provider`:** A popular choice for managing state in Flutter apps. It offers a more scalable approach by separating business logic from UI components, making the codebase more maintainable.

Here's a simple example of using `Provider` to manage a list of tasks:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => TaskData(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class TaskData extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<String> _tasks = [];

  List<String> get tasks => _tasks;

  void addTask(String task) {
    _tasks.add(task);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void removeTask(int index) {
    _tasks.removeAt(index);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

#### Managing Task Data

The core of our To-Do app is the task list, which we will maintain in the app's state. This list will be dynamically updated as users add, edit, or delete tasks.

### CRUD Operations

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations form the backbone of our app's functionality. Let's explore how to implement each of these operations.

#### Creating Tasks

To add a new task, we need a user interface that allows users to input task details. We will then update the task list in the state.

```dart
class AddTaskScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    String newTaskTitle;

    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,
        children: <Widget>[
          TextField(
            autofocus: true,
            onChanged: (newText) {
              newTaskTitle = newText;
            },
          ),
          FlatButton(
            child: Text('Add'),
            onPressed: () {
              Provider.of<TaskData>(context, listen: false).addTask(newTaskTitle);
              Navigator.pop(context);
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Reading Tasks

Displaying tasks involves reading the current state and rendering it in the UI. We can use Flutter's `ListView` widget to dynamically display the list of tasks.

```dart
class TaskList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Consumer<TaskData>(
      builder: (context, taskData, child) {
        return ListView.builder(
          itemCount: taskData.tasks.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(taskData.tasks[index]),
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

#### Updating Tasks

To update a task, we need to allow users to edit the task details and then update the state accordingly.

```dart
void updateTask(int index, String newTaskTitle) {
  _tasks[index] = newTaskTitle;
  notifyListeners();
}
```

#### Deleting Tasks

Removing a task from the list is straightforward. We simply remove the task from the state and refresh the UI.

```dart
void removeTask(int index) {
  _tasks.removeAt(index);
  notifyListeners();
}
```

### Data Persistence

To ensure that tasks are not lost when the app is closed, we need to implement data persistence. There are several options available in Flutter for local storage.

#### Local Storage Options

- **`SharedPreferences`:** Suitable for simple key-value storage. Ideal for storing small amounts of data like user preferences.
  
- **`sqflite`:** A SQLite plugin for Flutter. It is a good choice for more complex data storage needs.
  
- **`hive`:** A lightweight and fast NoSQL database for Flutter. It is easy to use and integrates well with Flutter apps.

#### Implementing Persistence

Let's use `SharedPreferences` to persist our task list. This involves saving the task list whenever changes occur and loading it when the app starts.

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class TaskData extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<String> _tasks = [];

  List<String> get tasks => _tasks;

  Future<void> loadTasks() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    _tasks = prefs.getStringList('tasks') ?? [];
    notifyListeners();
  }

  Future<void> saveTasks() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    prefs.setStringList('tasks', _tasks);
  }

  void addTask(String task) {
    _tasks.add(task);
    saveTasks();
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void removeTask(int index) {
    _tasks.removeAt(index);
    saveTasks();
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

### Marking Tasks as Completed

To mark tasks as completed, we can add a boolean property to each task and update the UI accordingly.

```dart
class Task {
  final String name;
  bool isDone;

  Task({this.name, this.isDone = false});

  void toggleDone() {
    isDone = !isDone;
  }
}
```

Update the UI to reflect the completed status:

```dart
ListTile(
  title: Text(
    task.name,
    style: TextStyle(
      decoration: task.isDone ? TextDecoration.lineThrough : null,
    ),
  ),
  trailing: Checkbox(
    value: task.isDone,
    onChanged: (bool newValue) {
      task.toggleDone();
      notifyListeners();
    },
  ),
)
```

### Error Handling

#### Validations

Ensure that users cannot add empty tasks by validating input before updating the state.

```dart
if (newTaskTitle != null && newTaskTitle.isNotEmpty) {
  Provider.of<TaskData>(context, listen: false).addTask(newTaskTitle);
}
```

#### Exception Handling

Handle exceptions when interacting with local storage to prevent app crashes.

```dart
try {
  prefs.setStringList('tasks', _tasks);
} catch (e) {
  print('Failed to save tasks: $e');
}
```

### Visual Aids

#### Flowcharts

Below is a flowchart illustrating the logic flow for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Add Task?};
    B -->|Yes| C[Input Task Details];
    C --> D[Update State];
    D --> E[Save to Storage];
    E --> F[Refresh UI];
    B -->|No| G{Update/Delete Task?};
    G -->|Yes| H[Select Task];
    H --> I[Update/Delete State];
    I --> J[Save to Storage];
    J --> K[Refresh UI];
    G -->|No| L[End];
```

#### Code Diagrams

The following diagram shows how state changes impact the UI.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant State
    participant Storage

    User->>UI: Add Task
    UI->>State: Update Task List
    State->>Storage: Save Task List
    Storage-->>State: Confirmation
    State->>UI: Refresh UI
```

### Best Practices

#### Separation of Concerns

Keep business logic separate from UI code to enhance maintainability and scalability. Use models and services to handle data operations.

#### Scalability

Structure your code to facilitate future feature additions. Use design patterns like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or MVC (Model-View-Controller) to organize your codebase.

### Exercises

#### Feature Extension

- **Sorting Tasks:** Implement a feature that sorts tasks by creation date or priority.
- **Task Categories:** Allow users to categorize tasks and filter them based on categories.

### Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this chapter, you have implemented a functional To-Do app in Flutter. This app demonstrates key concepts such as state management, CRUD operations, data persistence, and error handling. As you continue to develop your app, consider exploring more advanced features and optimizations.
