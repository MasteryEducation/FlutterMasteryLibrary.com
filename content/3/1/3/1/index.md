## 1.3.1 Installing Flutter SDK

Setting up the Flutter SDK is the first step towards building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This guide will walk you through the installation process on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring you have a solid foundation to start your Flutter development journey.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation process, it's essential to ensure your system meets the necessary requirements for running Flutter. Each operating system has specific prerequisites that must be fulfilled.

#### Windows

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit).
- **Disk Space**: At least 1.64 GB of free disk space (excluding disk space for IDE/tools).
- **Git for Windows**: Required for cloning the Flutter repository and managing packages.

#### macOS

- **Operating System**: macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later.
- **Xcode**: Required for iOS development. Ensure you have the latest version installed from the Mac App Store.
- **Command Line Tools**: Install via Xcode or directly using the terminal command `xcode-select --install`.

#### Linux

- **Operating System**: Any modern 64-bit Linux distribution.
- **Required Libraries**: Ensure the following libraries are installed:
  - `bash`, `curl`, `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `unzip`, `which`, `xz-utils`
- **Additional Tools**: Depending on your distribution, you may need to install additional packages for Android development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

Let's explore the installation process for each operating system in detail.

#### Windows

1. **Download the Flutter SDK**:
   - Visit the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows) and download the latest stable Flutter SDK zip file.

2. **Extract the SDK**:
   - Extract the downloaded zip file to the desired installation directory, such as `C:\src\flutter`. Avoid installing Flutter in a directory that requires elevated privileges, such as `C:\Program Files`.

3. **Update System PATH**:
   - Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system PATH:
     - Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
     - Click on "Environment Variables".
     - Under "System variables", find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
     - Click "New" and add the path to the Flutter `bin` directory, e.g., `C:\src\flutter\bin`.
     - Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.

4. **Install Git for Windows**:
   - If not already installed, download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

#### macOS

1. **Clone the Flutter Repository**:
   - Open Terminal and run the following command to clone the Flutter repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the Flutter SDK zip file from the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos) and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Add Flutter to PATH**:
   - Open Terminal and run the following command to add Flutter to your PATH:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
     ```
   - To make this change permanent, add the above line to your shell's startup file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).

3. **Install Xcode**:
   - Ensure Xcode is installed from the Mac App Store. Open Xcode and agree to the license agreement if prompted.

4. **Install Command Line Tools**:
   - Run the following command in Terminal to install the necessary command line tools:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```

#### Linux

1. **Download the Flutter SDK**:
   - Open Terminal and run the following command to download the Flutter SDK:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
     ```

2. **Add Flutter to PATH**:
   - Run the following command to add Flutter to your PATH:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
     ```
   - To make this change permanent, add the above line to your shell's startup file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Depending on your Linux distribution, you may need to install additional libraries. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install curl git unzip xz-utils
     ```

### Visual Guides

### Verification

Once the installation is complete, it's crucial to verify that Flutter is set up correctly. Use the `flutter doctor` command to check the status of your installation:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It checks for any missing dependencies and provides guidance on how to resolve them.

- **Interpreting the Output**:
  - A green checkmark indicates that a component is correctly installed.
  - A red X indicates a missing dependency or an issue that needs to be addressed.
  - Follow the instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to resolve any issues.

### Regular Updates

Keeping Flutter up to date is essential to benefit from the latest features and improvements. To update Flutter, run the following command:

```bash
flutter upgrade
```

This command updates your Flutter installation to the latest stable version. It's a good practice to run this command regularly to ensure your development environment is current.

### Conclusion

Installing the Flutter SDK is a straightforward process, but it's essential to follow each step carefully to ensure a successful setup. By meeting the prerequisites, following the step-by-step instructions, and verifying your installation with `flutter doctor`, you'll be well on your way to developing cross-platform applications with Flutter.
