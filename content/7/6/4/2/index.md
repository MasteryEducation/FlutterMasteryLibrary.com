## 6.4.2 Normalizing State Shape

As Flutter applications evolve, managing state efficiently becomes crucial to maintaining performance and scalability. One advanced technique to achieve this is normalizing the state shape, particularly when using Redux for state management. This section delves into the need for normalization, how to implement it, and the benefits it brings to your Flutter applications.

### The Need for Normalization

In complex applications, state often involves nested and relational data structures. Without careful management, these structures can lead to data duplication, inefficient updates, and increased complexity. Normalizing the state shape addresses these issues by transforming nested data into flat structures, making updates more manageable and reducing redundancy.

#### Why Normalize?

- **Avoid Data Duplication:** By storing data in a normalized form, you ensure that each piece of information is stored only once. This reduces the risk of inconsistencies and makes updates straightforward.
- **Simplify Updates:** With a single source of truth for each entity, updates become localized, reducing the need for cascading changes across the state.
- **Improve Performance:** Flattened data structures can be accessed and updated more efficiently, leading to performance gains in large applications.

### Flattening Data Structures

Normalization involves transforming nested data into a flat structure using entities and references. This approach is akin to how relational databases manage data, where each entity is stored in a separate table and relationships are managed through foreign keys.

#### Example of Flattening

Consider a shopping cart application where products are stored within cart items. In a non-normalized state, the data might look like this:

```dart
// Non-normalized state
{
  cart: [
    {
      productId: '1',
      productDetails: { 'name': 'Widget', 'price': 25.0 },
      quantity: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

In this structure, product details are duplicated within each cart item. To normalize, separate the product details from the cart items:

```dart
// Normalized state
{
  products: {
    '1': { 'name': 'Widget', 'price': 25.0 }
  },
  cartItems: {
    '1': {
      productId: '1',
      quantity: 2
    }
  }
}
```

In this normalized state, the `products` object holds all product details, while `cartItems` maintains references to products by their IDs.

### Managing Relationships

Normalization also involves managing relationships between entities, such as products and categories. This can be achieved by maintaining separate collections for each entity and using identifiers to link them.

#### Handling Relationships

For example, if products belong to categories, you might structure your state as follows:

```dart
{
  categories: {
    'electronics': { 'name': 'Electronics' },
    'furniture': { 'name': 'Furniture' }
  },
  products: {
    '1': { 'name': 'Widget', 'price': 25.0, 'categoryId': 'electronics' },
    '2': { 'name': 'Chair', 'price': 45.0, 'categoryId': 'furniture' }
  }
}
```

Here, each product references its category by `categoryId`, allowing you to easily manage and query relationships.

### Using Libraries for Inspiration

While libraries like `normalizr` in Node.js automate normalization, in Dart, you often need to implement it manually. However, the principles remain the same: separate entities into distinct collections and use identifiers to manage relationships.

### Updates and Mutations

Normalized state simplifies updates because changes are localized to a single source of truth. For instance, updating a product's price only requires modifying the `products` collection, without affecting cart items directly.

#### Example of Updating Normalized State

Consider a function to update a product's price:

```dart
void updateProductPrice(String productId, double newPrice) {
  // Assuming `state` is your Redux state
  state = {
    ...state,
    products: {
      ...state.products,
      [productId]: {
        ...state.products[productId],
        price: newPrice
      }
    }
  };
}
```

This function updates the price of a product without needing to traverse and modify cart items, demonstrating the efficiency of normalized state.

### Reducers for Normalized Data

Reducers in a normalized state setup handle updates to specific entities, ensuring that changes are isolated and efficient.

#### Example Reducer

Here's an example of a reducer handling updates to products:

```dart
ProductState productReducer(ProductState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is UpdateProductPriceAction) {
    return {
      ...state,
      products: {
        ...state.products,
        [action.productId]: {
          ...state.products[action.productId],
          price: action.newPrice
        }
      }
    };
  }
  return state;
}
```

This reducer listens for `UpdateProductPriceAction` and updates the relevant product's price, illustrating how reducers can efficiently manage normalized data.

### Best Practices

- **Plan Early:** Design your state shape early in development to accommodate future needs and avoid costly refactoring.
- **Document the Schema:** Maintain clear documentation of your state schema to ensure team members understand the structure and relationships.
- **Use Consistent Naming:** Adopt consistent naming conventions for entities and references to maintain clarity and prevent confusion.

### Key Takeaways

- **Scalability:** Normalizing state provides scalability and performance benefits, particularly in complex applications.
- **Maintainability:** A well-structured state is easier to read, maintain, and extend, reducing the cognitive load on developers.
- **Efficiency:** By minimizing data duplication and localizing updates, normalized state enhances application performance.

### Conclusion

Normalizing state shape is a powerful technique in Redux that enhances the scalability, maintainability, and efficiency of your Flutter applications. By adopting these practices, you can manage complex state structures with ease, paving the way for robust and performant applications.
