## 6.2.4 Connecting Redux to Widgets

In this section, we delve into the practical aspects of integrating Redux with Flutter widgets. By understanding how to connect Redux to your widget tree, you can create applications that are both responsive and maintainable. We will cover the use of `StoreProvider`, `StoreConnector`, and ViewModels, providing you with the tools to effectively manage state in your Flutter applications.

### StoreProvider: Making the Redux Store Available

The `StoreProvider` is a fundamental component in the `flutter_redux` library. It acts as a bridge, making the Redux store accessible throughout your widget tree. By placing the `StoreProvider` at the root of your application, typically in `main.dart`, you ensure that all widgets have access to the store.

```dart
void main() {
  final store = Store<AppState>(
    appReducer,
    initialState: AppState.initial(),
    middleware: [/* your middleware here */],
  );

  runApp(MyApp(store: store));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Store<AppState> store;

  MyApp({required this.store});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider<AppState>(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Redux Example',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `StoreProvider` wraps the `MaterialApp`, ensuring that the Redux store is available to all descendant widgets. This setup is crucial for enabling state management across the entire application.

### StoreConnector: Connecting Widgets to the Store

The `StoreConnector` widget is a powerful tool provided by `flutter_redux` that connects a part of the widget tree to the Redux store. It listens for state changes and rebuilds the widget when necessary. This ensures that your UI remains in sync with the application's state.

```dart
StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel>(
  converter: (store) => ViewModel.fromStore(store),
  builder: (context, viewModel) {
    return Text('Item count: ${viewModel.itemCount}');
  },
);
```

#### The Converter Function

The `converter` function is a key component of the `StoreConnector`. It transforms the store into a ViewModel, which is then used by the UI. This function is responsible for extracting the necessary state and actions from the store, providing a clean interface for the UI.

### ViewModels: Mapping State to UI

ViewModels play a crucial role in separating the business logic from the presentation layer. They map the state to the properties and callbacks needed by the UI, allowing for a clean and maintainable codebase.

```dart
class ViewModel {
  final int itemCount;
  final Function() onAddItem;

  ViewModel({required this.itemCount, required this.onAddItem});

  static ViewModel fromStore(Store<AppState> store) {
    return ViewModel(
      itemCount: store.state.items.length,
      onAddItem: () => store.dispatch(AddItemAction(newItem)),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ViewModel` provides the `itemCount` and an `onAddItem` callback, encapsulating the logic needed by the UI. This abstraction simplifies the widget code and enhances testability.

### StoreBuilder: An Alternative to StoreConnector

While `StoreConnector` is ideal for widgets that need to rebuild in response to state changes, `StoreBuilder` offers a simpler alternative when you only need access to the store without triggering rebuilds. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to perform actions on the store without affecting the UI.

```dart
StoreBuilder<AppState>(
  builder: (context, store) {
    // Perform actions on the store
    return Container();
  },
);
```

### Performance Considerations

When using `StoreConnector`, it's important to design the `converter` function carefully to minimize unnecessary rebuilds. One effective strategy is to use the `distinct` parameter, which prevents rebuilds when the state hasn't changed.

```dart
StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel>(
  converter: (store) => ViewModel.fromStore(store),
  distinct: true,
  builder: (context, viewModel) {
    return Text('Item count: ${viewModel.itemCount}');
  },
);
```

### Best Practices

- **Stateless UI Components:** Keep your UI components stateless whenever possible. This simplifies the code and reduces the risk of bugs.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separate presentation (UI code) from container widgets (Redux connection logic). This enhances testability and maintainability.
- **Efficient ViewModels:** Design ViewModels to efficiently map state to UI properties, minimizing the amount of logic in the UI layer.

### Key Takeaways

Connecting widgets to the Redux store is a powerful technique that allows your UI to respond dynamically to state changes. By leveraging `StoreConnector` and ViewModels, you can build responsive and efficient UIs with Redux. Remember to follow best practices to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Practical Example: Building a Counter App

Let's apply these concepts by building a simple counter app using Redux.

#### Step 1: Define the App State

```dart
class AppState {
  final int counter;

  AppState({required this.counter});

  factory AppState.initial() => AppState(counter: 0);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Actions

```dart
class IncrementAction {}

class DecrementAction {}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Reducer

```dart
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is IncrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter + 1);
  } else if (action is DecrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter - 1);
  }
  return state;
}
```

#### Step 4: Set Up the Store

```dart
final store = Store<AppState>(
  appReducer,
  initialState: AppState.initial(),
);
```

#### Step 5: Connect the UI

```dart
class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel>(
      converter: (store) => ViewModel.fromStore(store),
      builder: (context, viewModel) {
        return Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Counter: ${viewModel.counter}'),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.add),
                  onPressed: viewModel.increment,
                ),
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.remove),
                  onPressed: viewModel.decrement,
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class ViewModel {
  final int counter;
  final Function() increment;
  final Function() decrement;

  ViewModel({required this.counter, required this.increment, required this.decrement});

  static ViewModel fromStore(Store<AppState> store) {
    return ViewModel(
      counter: store.state.counter,
      increment: () => store.dispatch(IncrementAction()),
      decrement: () => store.dispatch(DecrementAction()),
    );
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively connect Redux to your Flutter widgets, creating a responsive and maintainable application. Remember to leverage the power of `StoreProvider`, `StoreConnector`, and ViewModels to keep your code clean and efficient.
