## 6.2.3 Reducers

In the world of Redux, reducers play a pivotal role in managing the state of your Flutter applications. They are the pure functions responsible for determining how the state of an application changes in response to actions. Understanding reducers is crucial for implementing predictable and maintainable state management in your Flutter apps.

### Role of Reducers

Reducers are at the heart of Redux's state management. They are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. The key characteristics of reducers include:

- **Pure Functions:** Reducers must be pure, meaning given the same input, they should always produce the same output without causing any side effects. This ensures predictability and consistency in state management.
- **No Side Effects:** Reducers should not perform any operations that have side effects, such as API calls or modifying global variables. Their sole responsibility is to compute the new state based on the current state and the action received.

#### Example of a Reducer Function

Let's consider a simple example of a reducer function in a Flutter application:

```dart
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  return AppState(
    items: itemsReducer(state.items, action),
    // Other state fields can be added here
  );
}
```

In this example, `appReducer` is a root reducer that combines several sub-reducers, such as `itemsReducer`, to manage different parts of the application state. Each sub-reducer is responsible for handling a specific slice of the state.

### Writing a Reducer

Writing a reducer involves defining how the state should change in response to specific actions. Here's a step-by-step guide to writing a reducer:

1. **Define the Initial State:** Start by defining the initial state of your application. This is the state before any actions have been dispatched.

2. **Create Action Types:** Define the actions that your reducer will handle. Each action should have a unique type.

3. **Implement the Reducer Function:** Write the reducer function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.

4. **Ensure Immutability:** Always return a new state object instead of modifying the existing state. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the state.

### Combining Reducers

In complex applications, it's common to have multiple reducers handling different parts of the state. Redux provides a utility function called `combineReducers` to combine these reducers into a single root reducer.

#### Code Example: Combining Reducers

```dart
final itemsReducer = combineReducers<List<Item>>([
  TypedReducer<List<Item>, AddItemAction>(_addItem),
  TypedReducer<List<Item>, RemoveItemAction>(_removeItem),
]);

List<Item> _addItem(List<Item> items, AddItemAction action) {
  return List.from(items)..add(action.item);
}

List<Item> _removeItem(List<Item> items, RemoveItemAction action) {
  return items.where((item) => item.id != action.itemId).toList();
}
```

In this example, `combineReducers` is used to combine two reducers: `_addItem` and `_removeItem`. Each reducer handles a specific action type, ensuring that the state transitions are well-organized and maintainable.

### Using Typed Reducers

Typed reducers provide a way to ensure type safety and cleaner code. By using `TypedReducer`, you can specify the types of actions that a reducer can handle, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

### Immutability

Immutability is a core principle in Redux. It ensures that the state is not directly modified, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. Instead, reducers should always return a new state object.

#### Code Example for Immutable Update

```dart
AppState newState = state.copyWith(
  items: itemsReducer(state.items, action),
);
```

In this example, the `copyWith` method is used to create a new state object with updated values. This approach ensures that the original state remains unchanged, preserving the integrity of the application state.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Reducers Simple:** Reducers should be simple and focused on handling state transitions. Avoid placing complex business logic within reducers.
- **Avoid Side Effects:** Ensure that reducers do not perform any operations that have side effects, such as API calls or modifying global variables.
- **Use Typed Reducers:** Leverage typed reducers to ensure type safety and cleaner code.

### Key Takeaways

- **Predictable State Management:** Reducers dictate how the state evolves over time in response to actions, ensuring predictable state management.
- **Pure Functions:** Writing pure, side-effect-free reducers is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application state.
- **Immutability:** Always return a new state object to ensure immutability and prevent unintended side effects.

By adhering to these principles and best practices, you can effectively manage state in your Flutter applications using Redux, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases.
