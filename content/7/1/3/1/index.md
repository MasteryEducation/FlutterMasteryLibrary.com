  - Bash: Necessary for running shell scripts (included in Git for Windows).

- **Hardware:**
  - RAM: Minimum 4 GB (8 GB recommended for smooth performance)
  - CPU: Intel i5 or equivalent (64-bit)

### Installation Steps

#### Windows Installation

1. **Download Flutter SDK:**
   - Visit the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows) and download the latest stable release of Flutter SDK for Windows.
   - Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice, such as `C:\flutter`.

2. **Update Your Path:**
   - Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the System Properties window.
   - Under "System variables", find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
   - Click "New" and add the path to the Flutter bin directory, e.g., `C:\flutter\bin`.
   - Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.

3. **Install Git:**
   - Download and install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - During installation, ensure that "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" is selected.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run `flutter doctor`.
   - Follow any additional instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to complete the setup.

#### macOS Installation

1. **Install Homebrew (if not installed):**
   - Open Terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Install Flutter SDK:**
   - Use Homebrew to install Flutter:
     ```bash
     brew install --cask flutter
     ```

3. **Update Your Path:**
   - Add Flutter to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:`flutter/bin`"
     ```
   - Apply the changes by running `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run `flutter doctor` in Terminal to check for any missing dependencies.

#### Linux Installation

1. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   - Open Terminal and run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git curl xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
     ```

   - Use the following command to download and extract Flutter SDK:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
     ```

3. **Update Your Path:**
   - Add Flutter to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
     ```
   - Apply the changes by running `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run `flutter doctor` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

### Environment Variables

Setting up environment variables is crucial for accessing Flutter globally from any terminal session.

- **Windows:**
  - Use the System Properties to add `C:\flutter\bin` to the `Path` variable.

- **macOS/Linux:**
  - Modify your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.bashrc`) to include the Flutter bin directory in the `PATH`.

### Verifying Installation

Once Flutter is installed, it's important to verify the setup using the `flutter doctor` command. This tool checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

- **Running `flutter doctor`:**
  - Open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Type `flutter doctor` and press Enter.

- **Interpreting Output:**
  - The output will list any missing dependencies or issues.
  - Common issues include missing Android SDK or Xcode on macOS.
