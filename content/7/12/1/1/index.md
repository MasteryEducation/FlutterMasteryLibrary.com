### Mermaid.js Diagrams

To better understand the architectural differences between these libraries and existing solutions, let's examine a comparison of state flow in GetX versus Provider:

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph GetX
    Controller[Controller] --> View[View]
    View --> Controller
  end
  subgraph Provider
    View1[View] --> Provider[Provider]
    Provider --> View2[View]
  end
```

In GetX, the Controller directly interacts with the View, allowing for a more streamlined communication flow. In contrast, Provider acts as an intermediary between Views, promoting a more decoupled architecture.
