## 8.1.3 Real-World Examples

In the evolving landscape of Flutter development, leveraging multiple state management solutions within a single application can provide a robust and scalable architecture. This approach allows developers to harness the strengths of different solutions, tailoring them to specific needs within the app. In this section, we delve into two comprehensive case studies: an e-commerce application and a social media app, each illustrating how combining state management solutions can optimize performance and maintainability.

### Case Study 1: E-commerce Application

In this e-commerce application, we explore how `Provider` and `Bloc` can be effectively combined to manage different aspects of the app's state. The shopping cart, which requires simple and frequent updates, is managed using `Provider`, while the more complex user authentication flow is handled by `Bloc`.

#### Shopping Cart with Provider

The shopping cart in an e-commerce app is a prime example of ephemeral state that changes frequently as users add or remove items. `Provider` is an ideal choice here due to its simplicity and efficiency in managing local state.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class CartModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  final List<String> _items = [];

  List<String> get items => _items;

  void addItem(String item) {
    _items.add(item);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void removeItem(String item) {
    _items.remove(item);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CartModel(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('E-commerce App')),
        body: Consumer<CartModel>(
          builder: (context, cart, child) {
            return ListView.builder(
              itemCount: cart.items.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(cart.items[index]),
                  trailing: IconButton(
                    icon: Icon(Icons.remove),
                    onPressed: () => cart.removeItem(cart.items[index]),
                  ),
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () => Provider.of<CartModel>(context, listen: false).addItem('New Item'),
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `CartModel` is a `ChangeNotifier` that holds the cart's state.
- `Provider` is used to manage and update the cart state efficiently.
- `Consumer` widget listens for changes and rebuilds the UI accordingly.

#### User Authentication with Bloc

User authentication involves more complex logic, such as handling asynchronous operations and managing multiple states (e.g., loading, authenticated, error). `Bloc` is well-suited for this task due to its separation of concerns and use of streams.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

// Events
abstract class AuthEvent {}

class LoginEvent extends AuthEvent {
  final String username;
  final String password;

  LoginEvent(this.username, this.password);
}

// States
abstract class AuthState {}

class AuthInitial extends AuthState {}

class AuthLoading extends AuthState {}

class Authenticated extends AuthState {}

class AuthError extends AuthState {
  final String message;

  AuthError(this.message);
}

// Bloc
class AuthBloc extends Bloc<AuthEvent, AuthState> {
  AuthBloc() : super(AuthInitial());

  @override
  Stream<AuthState> mapEventToState(AuthEvent event) async* {
    if (event is LoginEvent) {
      yield AuthLoading();
      try {
        // Simulate network call
        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
        yield Authenticated();
      } catch (e) {
        yield AuthError('Login failed');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `AuthBloc` manages the authentication state using events and states.
- `LoginEvent` triggers the authentication process.
- `AuthState` represents different states of the authentication flow.

#### Integration and Architecture

Combining `Provider` and `Bloc` allows each part of the application to use the most appropriate state management solution. The architecture can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Interface] --> B[Provider for Cart]
    A --> C[Bloc for Authentication]
    B --> D[CartModel]
    C --> E[AuthBloc]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**
- The UI interacts with both `Provider` and `Bloc`.
- `Provider` manages the cart state through `CartModel`.
- `Bloc` handles authentication logic through `AuthBloc`.

### Case Study 2: Social Media App

In this social media application, we explore how `Redux` and `Riverpod` can be combined to manage global and local states, respectively. `Redux` is used for managing global app state, such as user data and settings, while `Riverpod` is used for local state management within specific widgets.

#### Global State Management with Redux

`Redux` is ideal for managing global state due to its predictable state container and unidirectional data flow. In this app, it manages user data and settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_redux/flutter_redux.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';

// Actions
class UpdateUserAction {
  final String username;

  UpdateUserAction(this.username);
}

// Reducer
String userReducer(String state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is UpdateUserAction) {
    return action.username;
  }
  return state;
}

// Store
final store = Store<String>(userReducer, initialState: 'Guest');

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreProvider(
      store: store,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Social Media App')),
          body: StoreConnector<String, String>(
            converter: (store) => store.state,
            builder: (context, username) {
              return Center(child: Text('Hello, $username'));
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `UpdateUserAction` is an action to update the username.
- `userReducer` updates the state based on actions.
- `StoreProvider` and `StoreConnector` integrate Redux with the UI.

#### Local State Management with Riverpod

`Riverpod` is used for managing local state within specific widgets, providing a more flexible and modern approach compared to `Provider`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

final counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) => 0);

void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
        body: Center(
          child: Consumer(builder: (context, watch, child) {
            final count = watch(counterProvider).state;
            return Text('$count');
          }),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            context.read(counterProvider).state++;
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `counterProvider` is a `StateProvider` managing the counter state.
- `Consumer` widget listens to state changes and rebuilds the UI.

#### Integration and Architecture

The integration of `Redux` and `Riverpod` in the social media app can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Interface] --> B[Redux for Global State]
    A --> C[Riverpod for Local State]
    B --> D[User Data & Settings]
    C --> E[Widget-specific State]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**
- The UI interacts with both `Redux` and `Riverpod`.
- `Redux` manages global state such as user data.
- `Riverpod` handles local state within specific widgets.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
