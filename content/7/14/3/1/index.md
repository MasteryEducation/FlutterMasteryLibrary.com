## 14.3.1 Practice Projects

In the journey of mastering state management in Flutter, theory alone is not enough. Practical application through projects is essential to solidify your understanding and gain confidence in implementing state management solutions. This section provides you with a set of practice projects designed to reinforce the concepts you've learned throughout this book. These projects not only serve as a platform for experimentation but also encourage you to tailor them to your interests and needs.

### Introduction

Applying knowledge through practical projects is invaluable. It allows you to:

- **Reinforce Learning:** By implementing concepts in real-world scenarios, you deepen your understanding.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Encountering and overcoming challenges in projects sharpens your ability to troubleshoot and adapt.
- **Build a Portfolio:** Completed projects can showcase your skills to potential employers or clients.
- **Foster Creativity:** Customizing projects to your interests encourages innovation and personal investment.

As you embark on these practice projects, remember that the goal is not just to complete them but to explore and experiment with different state management techniques. Feel free to modify and extend these projects to suit your interests and the specific challenges you wish to tackle.

### Suggested Practice Projects

#### Note-Taking App

**Description:** Create an app where users can create, edit, and delete notes. This project focuses on managing a list of notes, handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and syncing data locally or to a backend.

**State Management Focus:**

- **Managing Notes List:** Use state management to handle the list of notes efficiently.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implement state changes for creating, editing, and deleting notes.
- **Data Persistence:** Explore local storage solutions like SQLite or Hive, or sync with a backend using REST APIs.

**Key Features to Implement:**

- **Add/Edit/Delete Notes:** Allow users to manage their notes with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature to filter notes by keywords.
- **Categorization:** Enable users to categorize notes for better organization.

**Code Example:**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(NoteApp());

class NoteApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NoteListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class NoteListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NoteListScreenState createState() => _NoteListScreenState();
}

class _NoteListScreenState extends State<NoteListScreen> {
  List<String> notes = [];

  void addNote() {
    setState(() {
      notes.add('New Note ${notes.length + 1}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Notes')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: notes.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(notes[index]),
            trailing: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.delete),
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  notes.removeAt(index);
                });
              },
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: addNote,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Weather Forecast App

**Description:** Develop an app that displays current weather and forecasts using a public API. This project emphasizes handling asynchronous API calls, managing loading and error states, and updating the UI reactively.

**State Management Focus:**

- **Asynchronous API Calls:** Use state management to handle data fetching from a weather API.
- **Loading and Error States:** Implement state changes to reflect loading and error conditions.
- **Reactive UI Updates:** Ensure the UI updates automatically when new data is fetched.

**Key Features to Implement:**

- **Current Weather Display:** Show current weather conditions for a selected location.
- **Forecast Information:** Provide a 5-day weather forecast with daily summaries.
- **Location Search:** Allow users to search for weather data by city or coordinates.

**Code Example:**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

void main() => runApp(WeatherApp());

class WeatherApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: WeatherScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WeatherScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeatherScreenState createState() => _WeatherScreenState();
}

class _WeatherScreenState extends State<WeatherScreen> {
  String weather = 'Loading...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchWeather();
  }

  Future<void> fetchWeather() async {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q=London'));
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        weather = jsonDecode(response.body)['current']['condition']['text'];
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        weather = 'Error fetching weather';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Weather')),
      body: Center(child: Text(weather)),
    );
  }
}
```
