## 7.1.3 Setting Up MobX in Flutter

MobX is a powerful and flexible state management library that leverages reactive programming principles to make your Flutter applications more dynamic and responsive. In this section, we'll explore how to set up MobX in a Flutter project, covering everything from adding dependencies to creating a MobX store and running code generation. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to integrate MobX into your Flutter applications effectively.

### Adding Dependencies

To begin, you'll need to add the necessary MobX packages to your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file. These packages include `flutter_mobx` for Flutter-specific bindings, `mobx` for the core MobX functionality, `mobx_codegen` for code generation, and `build_runner` to facilitate the code generation process.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_mobx: ^2.0.0
  mobx: ^2.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.1.0
  mobx_codegen: ^2.0.0
```

- **`flutter_mobx`:** This package provides the necessary widgets and utilities to integrate MobX with Flutter.
- **`mobx`:** The core library that enables reactive state management.
- **`mobx_codegen`:** A code generation library that automates the creation of boilerplate code required for MobX.
- **`build_runner`:** A tool to run code generation commands, essential for generating the `.g.dart` files.

### Installing Packages

Once you've added the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal to install them:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command fetches the packages and makes them available in your project.

### Creating a MobX Store

A MobX store is a class that encapsulates the state and business logic of your application. It uses observables to track state changes and actions to modify the state. Let's walk through the process of creating a simple MobX store.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

Start by importing the MobX library and specifying a part file for code generation. The part file will contain the generated code.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';
part 'counter_store.g.dart';
```

- **`part 'counter_store.g.dart';`:** This directive tells Dart to include the generated code from the `counter_store.g.dart` file. This file is automatically generated by the code generation process.

#### Step 2: Annotate the Class

Next, define your store class. Use the `@store` annotation to mark it for code generation, and extend it with the generated class.

```dart
@store
abstract class _CounterStore with Store {
  // Observables and actions
}

class CounterStore = _CounterStore with _$CounterStore;
```

- **`@store`:** This annotation indicates that the class is a MobX store and should be processed by the code generator.
- **`abstract class _CounterStore with Store`:** The abstract class holds the state and logic. The `Store` mixin provides the necessary functionality for observables and actions.
- **`class CounterStore = _CounterStore with _$CounterStore;`:** This line creates a concrete implementation of the store by combining the abstract class with the generated code.

#### Step 3: Define Observables and Actions

Within your store, define observables to represent the state and actions to modify it. Here's an example of a simple counter store:

```dart
@store
abstract class _CounterStore with Store {
  @observable
  int count = 0;

  @action
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
}
```

- **`@observable`:** Marks a field as an observable, allowing MobX to track changes to its value.
- **`@action`:** Marks a method as an action, indicating that it modifies the state.

### Running Code Generation

To generate the `.g.dart` files, you'll need to run the build runner. This process creates the necessary boilerplate code for your MobX store.

#### Build Command

Run the following command to generate the code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command processes all annotated classes and generates the corresponding `.g.dart` files.

#### Watch Command

For continuous code generation during development, use the watch command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

This command automatically regenerates the code whenever changes are detected, streamlining the development process.

### Handling Build Errors

During the code generation process, you might encounter errors. Here are some common issues and troubleshooting tips:

- **Version Conflicts:** Ensure that all packages are compatible with each other. Check the package documentation for version compatibility.
- **Missing Annotations:** Verify that all necessary annotations (`@store`, `@observable`, `@action`) are present.
- **Cleaning the Build Cache:** If you encounter persistent issues, try cleaning the build cache:

  ```bash
  flutter pub run build_runner clean
  ```

This command clears the generated files, allowing you to start fresh.

### Best Practices

When working with MobX, consider the following best practices to maintain clean and efficient code:

- **Keep Store Classes Focused:** Ensure that each store class is responsible for a specific part of the application's state. Avoid mixing unrelated logic.
- **Separate UI from Business Logic:** Use MobX stores to manage state and logic, while keeping UI code in Flutter widgets. This separation enhances maintainability and readability.
- **Use Code Generation Wisely:** Leverage code generation to reduce boilerplate, but remain aware of the generated code and its impact on your project.

### Visualizing the Setup Process

To better understand the flow of setting up MobX in a Flutter project, consider the following Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid

```

This diagram illustrates the sequential steps involved in setting up MobX, from adding dependencies to following best practices.

### Key Takeaways
