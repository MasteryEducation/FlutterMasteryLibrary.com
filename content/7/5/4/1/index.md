## 5.4.1 Project Overview: Weather App

In this section, we will delve into the development of a weather application using the Bloc pattern in Flutter. This project will serve as a practical example of how to manage state effectively in a complex app. We'll cover the app's features, data sourcing, architecture planning, and project setup. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear understanding of how to build a robust weather app using Bloc, along with insights into best practices for state management.

### App Features

Our weather app will include the following key features:

- **Display Current Weather for a Selected City:**
  - Users can view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather description for a city of their choice.

- **Search for Cities:**
  - A search functionality will allow users to find and select cities to view their weather data.

- **Show Forecast Data:**
  - The app will provide a weather forecast for the upcoming days, giving users a comprehensive view of future weather conditions.

These features will not only make the app functional but also demonstrate the capabilities of the Bloc pattern in handling complex state management scenarios.

### Data Source

To fetch weather data, we will use a public weather API. One popular choice is the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides extensive weather data, including current conditions and forecasts.

#### Handling API Keys Securely

When using external APIs, it's crucial to handle API keys securely to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. Here are some best practices:

- **Environment Variables:** Store API keys in environment variables rather than hardcoding them into your source code.
- **Secure Storage:** Use secure storage solutions, such as the Flutter `flutter_secure_storage` package, to store sensitive information on the device.
- **Backend Proxy:** Consider setting up a backend server to act as a proxy for API requests, keeping the API key hidden from the client-side application.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your API keys remain secure, reducing the risk of exposure.

### Architecture Planning

Before diving into the code, it's essential to plan the app's architecture. We'll use the Bloc pattern, which promotes a clear separation of concerns and a reactive approach to state management. Additionally, we'll incorporate clean architecture principles to ensure the app is maintainable and scalable.

#### Key Architectural Components

- **Bloc:** The core component that manages the app's state and business logic. It receives events and emits states in response.
- **Repository:** A layer responsible for data fetching and caching, abstracting the data source from the Bloc.
- **UI Layer:** Consists of Flutter widgets that react to state changes emitted by the Bloc.

This architecture will allow us to build a modular and testable application, where each component has a well-defined responsibility.

### Project Setup

Let's start by setting up a new Flutter project and installing the necessary dependencies.

#### Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create weather_app
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd weather_app
```

#### Step 2: Add Dependencies

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bloc: ^8.0.0
  http: ^0.13.3
  equatable: ^2.0.3
  json_annotation: ^4.3.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.1.5
  json_serializable: ^6.1.1
```

- **flutter_bloc:** Provides the Bloc and Cubit classes for state management.
- **http:** A package for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
- **equatable:** Used for value comparison in Bloc states and events.
- **json_annotation, build_runner, json_serializable:** These are used for JSON serialization and code generation.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Project Structure

Organize your project into the following directories:

- **lib/bloc:** Contains Bloc and Cubit classes.
- **lib/models:** Holds data models and JSON serialization logic.
- **lib/repository:** Includes repository classes for data fetching.
- **lib/screens:** Contains Flutter widgets for the UI.
- **lib/widgets:** Reusable UI components.

This structure will help maintain a clean separation of concerns, making the app easier to navigate and maintain.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you have set the foundation for developing a weather app using the Bloc pattern in Flutter. We've outlined the app's features, discussed data sourcing and API key security, planned the architecture, and set up the project structure. In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into implementing each component, focusing on how Bloc facilitates effective state management.
