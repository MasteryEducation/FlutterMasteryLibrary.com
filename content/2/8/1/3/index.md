## 8.1.3 App Screenshots and Promotional Graphics

In the competitive world of mobile apps, first impressions matter. App screenshots and promotional graphics are not just visual representations of your app; they are powerful marketing tools that can significantly influence a user's decision to download your app. This section will guide you through the process of creating compelling screenshots and promotional graphics that effectively showcase your Flutter app's features in the app stores.

### Importance of Screenshots and Graphics

Screenshots and promotional graphics are often the first interaction potential users have with your app. They serve as a window into your app's functionality, design, and overall appeal. High-quality visuals can enhance your app's attractiveness, convey professionalism, and increase the likelihood of downloads. In essence, they are your app's visual pitch to potential users.

### Screenshot Guidelines

#### Number of Screenshots

The number of screenshots you can upload varies between the iOS App Store and Google Play Store:

- **iOS App Store:** You can upload up to 10 screenshots per device type.
- **Google Play Store:** You are allowed a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 screenshots.

Having a variety of screenshots allows you to highlight different features and aspects of your app, catering to diverse user interests.

#### Screenshot Dimensions

Different devices require specific screenshot dimensions. Here are the standard sizes:

- **iOS Devices:**
  - iPhone 6.5" Display: 1242 x 2688 pixels
  - iPhone 5.5" Display: 1242 x 2208 pixels
  - iPad Pro (3rd Gen) 12.9" Display: 2048 x 2732 pixels

- **Android Devices:**
  - Phone: 1080 x 1920 pixels
  - Tablet: 1600 x 2560 pixels

Ensure that your screenshots are in the correct resolution to avoid any distortion or rejection during submission.

#### Orientation

The orientation of your screenshots should align with your app's design and user experience:

- **Portrait Orientation:** Ideal for apps that are primarily used in a vertical layout, such as social media or messaging apps.
- **Landscape Orientation:** Suitable for games or apps that offer a wide-screen experience.

Consider using a mix of both orientations if your app supports it, to provide a comprehensive view of your app's capabilities.

#### File Format and Naming Conventions

- **File Formats:** JPEG and PNG are the most commonly accepted formats.
- **Naming Conventions:** While there are no strict naming conventions, using descriptive names can help you organize your files better. For example, `feature1_portrait.png`.

### Designing Effective Screenshots

#### Showcase Key Features

Select screenshots that highlight the most important and unique aspects of your app. Focus on features that set your app apart from competitors and provide value to users.

#### Use Captions and Overlays

Adding brief, engaging text can help explain features or benefits. However, it's crucial to balance text with visual elements to avoid clutter. Use overlays to draw attention to specific parts of the screenshot.

#### Consistency

Maintain a consistent style, color scheme, and layout across all screenshots. This consistency reinforces your brand identity and makes your app appear more professional.

#### Localization

If your app targets multiple regions, consider localizing your screenshots. This involves translating text and adapting visuals to suit cultural preferences, which can enhance user engagement in different markets.

### Promotional Graphics

#### App Store (iOS)

- **App Previews:** These are short videos (15-30 seconds) that demonstrate the app's features and functionality. Ensure that your video is engaging and highlights the core aspects of your app.

#### Google Play (Android)

- **Feature Graphic:** A 1024 x 500 pixel image that appears at the top of your app's store listing. This graphic should be eye-catching and convey the essence of your app.
- **Promo Video:** An optional video that can be linked from YouTube. It should complement your screenshots and provide a dynamic overview of your app.
- **TV Banner:** For apps available on Android TV, a 1280 x 720 pixel banner is required.

### Creation Process

#### Tools and Resources

Creating high-quality screenshots and graphics requires the right tools. Here are some recommendations:

- **Design Tools:** Sketch, Photoshop, Canva, and Figma are excellent for designing and editing graphics.
- **Mockup Generators:** Tools like Placeit and Smartmockups can help you place app screenshots into device frames, enhancing their professional appearance.

#### Best Practices

- **High-Resolution Images:** Always use high-resolution images to ensure clarity and detail.
- **Testing:** Test how your screenshots look on different devices to ensure they appear as intended.

### Submission Guidelines

#### Compliance with Platform Requirements

Before submitting your app, ensure that your screenshots and graphics comply with the latest guidelines from Apple and Google. This includes adhering to size, format, and content requirements.

#### Avoiding Rejection

To avoid rejection, do not include prohibited content such as placeholder images, irrelevant screenshots, or content that violates platform policies. Always double-check your submissions for compliance.

### Visual Aids
